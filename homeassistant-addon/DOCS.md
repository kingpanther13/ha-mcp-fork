## Installation


1. **Click the button to add the repository** to your Home Assistant instance:

   [![Add Repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhomeassistant-ai%2Fha-mcp)

   Or manually add this repository URL in Supervisor → Add-on Store:
   ```
   https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp
   ```

2. **Navigate to the add-on** "Home Assistant MCP Server" from the add-on store

3. **Click Install, Wait and then Start**

4. **Check the add-on logs** for your unique MCP server URL:

   ```
   🔐 MCP Server URL: http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw

   ```

5. **Configure your AI client** using one of the options below

---

## Client Configuration

### <details><summary><b>📱 Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Claude Desktop requires a proxy to connect to HTTP MCP servers. Install **mcp-proxy** first:

```bash
# Install mcp-proxy
uv tool install mcp-proxy
# or
pipx install mcp-proxy
```

Then add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Location:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "home-assistant": {
      "command": "mcp-proxy",
      "args": ["--transport", "streamablehttp", "http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the URL in `args` with the one from your add-on logs.

**Restart Claude Desktop** after saving the configuration.

**How it works:** mcp-proxy converts the HTTP endpoint to stdio that Claude Desktop can use.

</details>

### <details><summary><b>💻 Claude Code</b></summary>

Use the `claude mcp add` command:

```bash
claude mcp add-json home-assistant '{
  "url": "http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw",
  "type": "http"
}'
```

Replace the URL with the one from your add-on logs.

**Restart Claude Code** after adding the configuration.

</details>

### <details><summary><b>🌐 Web Clients (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc.)</b></summary>

For secure remote access without port forwarding, use the **Cloudflared add-on**:

#### Install Cloudflared Add-on

[![Add Cloudflared Repository](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrenner-tobias%2Faddon-cloudflared)

#### Configure Cloudflared

**Note:** The Cloudflared add-on requires a Cloudflare account and uses named tunnels. You'll need to authenticate via the browser flow when first setting up the tunnel.

Add to Cloudflared add-on configuration:

```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: ha-mcp  # Named tunnel (requires Cloudflare account)
    service: http://localhost:9583
```

Or with a custom domain (requires DNS setup in Cloudflare):
```yaml
additional_hosts:
  - hostname: ha-mcp.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:9583
```

#### Authenticate and Get Your Public URL

When you first start Cloudflared:

1. **Check the add-on logs** for an authentication URL like:
   ```
   Please open the following URL and log in with your Cloudflare account:
   https://xyz.cloudflare.com/argotunnel?...
   ```

2. **Open the URL in your browser**, log in with your Cloudflare account, and select a website to authorize the tunnel

3. **After authentication**, the logs will show your tunnel URL:
   - Named tunnel: `https://ha-mcp-<random>.cfargotunnel.com`
   - Custom domain: `https://ha-mcp.yourdomain.com` (if DNS configured)

#### Use Your MCP Server

Combine the Cloudflare tunnel URL with your secret path:
```
https://ha-mcp-<random>.cfargotunnel.com/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw
```

**Benefits:**
- No port forwarding required
- Automatic HTTPS encryption
- Optional Cloudflare Zero Trust authentication
- Centrally managed with other Home Assistant services

**Note on Quick Tunnels:** True Quick Tunnel mode (temporary `*.trycloudflare.com` URLs without account) requires running `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:9583` directly via CLI or Docker, which is not supported by this add-on. The Home Assistant Cloudflared add-on uses named tunnels that require a Cloudflare account for authentication and management.

#### ⚠️ Disable "Block AI Training Bots"

> **This is the most common connection issue for Cloudflare users.** If your LLM client can't connect but visiting the URL in your browser works, this setting is almost certainly the cause.

Cloudflare's "Block AI training bots" feature blocks requests from AI/LLM clients by default. You must disable it:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. In the left sidebar, click **Domains**, then click **Overview**
3. Click on the domain you use for connecting to Home Assistant
4. On the right side of the page, find **"Control AI Crawlers"**
5. Under **"Block AI training bots"**, open the dropdown
6. Select **"do not block (allow crawlers)"**

![Cloudflare AI Crawlers Setting](https://homeassistant-ai.github.io/ha-mcp/images/cloudflare-ai-crawlers-setting.jpg)

See [Cloudflared add-on documentation](https://github.com/brenner-tobias/addon-cloudflared/blob/main/cloudflared/DOCS.md) for advanced configuration.

## Configuration Options

The add-on has minimal configuration - most settings are automatic.

### backup_hint (Advanced)

**Default:** `normal`

Controls when the AI assistant suggests creating backups before operations:

- `normal` (recommended): Before irreversible operations only
- `strong`: Before first modification of each session
- `weak`: Rarely suggests backups
- `auto`: Intelligent detection (future enhancement)

**Note:** This is an advanced option. Enable "Show unused optional configuration options" in the add-on configuration UI to see it.

### secret_path (Advanced)

**Default:** Empty (auto-generated)

Custom secret path override. **Leave empty for auto-generation** (recommended).

- When empty, the add-on generates a secure 128-bit random path on first start
- The path is persisted to `/data/secret_path.txt` and reused on restarts
- Custom paths are useful for migration or specific security requirements

**Note:** This is an advanced option. Enable "Show unused optional configuration options" in the add-on configuration UI to see it.

### enable_tool_search

**Default:** `false`

Replaces the full tool catalog (~93 tools, ~46K tokens) with search-based discovery (~4 proxy tools, ~5K tokens). When enabled, tools are found via `ha_search_tools` and executed through categorized proxies (read/write/delete).

**When to enable:**
- Models **without native deferred tool support** — this includes OpenAI-compatible local models, and also **Claude Haiku** which does not use Claude's built-in deferred tool loading. Haiku users will see significant token savings with this enabled.
- Models with **limited context windows** (≤200K) or deployments where context cost is a concern
- MCP clients that **cap total tools** (e.g. at 100) — reduces visible tool count to ~4

**When to leave disabled (default):**
- Claude Sonnet/Opus or other clients with deferred tool support — tools are loaded on demand, so the full catalog has no idle context cost
- When you need direct tool access without the search step

Requires add-on restart to take effect.

### enable_yaml_config_editing

**Default:** `false`

Allow AI assistants to add, replace, or remove top-level keys in `configuration.yaml` and `packages/*.yaml`. Only whitelisted keys are allowed (e.g., `template`, `sensor`, `command_line`, `mqtt`). Core keys like `homeassistant`, `http`, and `recorder` are blocked. A backup is created before every edit.

Use for YAML-only features that have no UI or API alternative.

Requires add-on restart to take effect.

### enabled_tools

A nested configuration structure for enabling/disabling individual tools or entire tool groups. Tools are organized by category (Add-ons, Automations, HACS, System, etc.). Each group has an `enabled` master toggle plus individual tool toggles.

**Group toggle behavior:** Setting a group's `enabled` to `false` disables all tools in that group regardless of individual tool settings.

**Mandatory tools** that cannot be disabled (silently re-enabled): `ha_search_entities`, `ha_get_overview`, `ha_get_state`, `ha_report_issue`. When tool search is enabled, the search and proxy tools are also mandatory.

Requires add-on restart to take effect.

### pinned_tools

A nested configuration structure for pinning tools (keeping them always visible when tool search is enabled). Tools are organized by the same groups as `enabled_tools`. Only pinned tools (set to `true`) are shown without needing to search.

**Default pinned tools** include: `ha_search_entities`, `ha_get_overview`, `ha_restart`, `ha_reload_core`, `ha_backup_create`, `ha_backup_restore`, `ha_config_get_automation`, `ha_config_set_automation`, `ha_config_set_yaml`, `ha_report_issue`.

Has no effect when tool search is disabled.

Requires add-on restart to take effect.

### tool_search_max_results

**Default:** `5`

Maximum number of results returned by `ha_search_tools` when tool search is enabled. Lower values (2-3) save context tokens but may miss relevant tools. Range: 2-10.

Requires add-on restart to take effect.

**Example Configuration:**

```yaml
backup_hint: normal
secret_path: ""  # Leave empty for auto-generation
enable_yaml_config_editing: false
enabled_tools:
  hacs:
    enabled: false  # Disable all HACS tools
  system:
    enabled: true
    ha_config_set_yaml: true  # Enabled here, but gated by enable_yaml_config_editing toggle
pinned_tools:
  system:
    ha_restart: true
    ha_backup_create: true
tool_search_max_results: 3
```

## Security

### Auto-Generated Secret Paths

The add-on automatically generates a unique secret path on first startup using 128-bit cryptographic entropy. This ensures:

- Each installation has a unique, unpredictable endpoint
- The secret is persisted across restarts
- No manual configuration needed

### Authentication

The add-on uses Home Assistant Supervisor's built-in authentication. No tokens or credentials are needed - the add-on automatically authenticates with your Home Assistant instance.

### Network Exposure

- **Local network only by default** - The add-on listens on port 9583
- **Remote access** - Use the Cloudflared add-on for secure HTTPS tunnels
- **Never expose** port 9583 directly to the internet without proper security measures

---

## Troubleshooting

### Add-on won't start

**Check the logs** for errors:
- Configuration validation errors
- Dependency installation failures
- Port conflicts (9583 already in use)

**Solution:** Review the error message and adjust configuration or free up the port.

### Can't connect to MCP server

**Verify:**
1. Add-on is running (check status in Supervisor)
2. You copied the **complete URL** including the secret path from logs
3. Your MCP client configuration is correct
4. No firewall blocking port 9583 on your local network

**Solution:** Restart the add-on and copy the URL from fresh logs.

### Lost the secret URL

**Options:**
1. Check the add-on logs (scroll to startup messages)
2. Restart the add-on (logs will show the URL again)
3. Read directly from `/data/secret_path.txt` using the Terminal & SSH add-on
4. Generate a new secret by deleting `/data/secret_path.txt` and restarting

### Operations failing

**Check add-on logs** for detailed error messages. Common issues:

- Invalid entity IDs (use fuzzy search to find correct IDs)
- Missing permissions (add-on should have full access)
- Home Assistant API errors (check HA logs)

**Solution:** Review the specific error in logs and adjust your commands accordingly.

### Performance issues

If the add-on is slow or unresponsive:

1. Check Home Assistant system resources (CPU, memory)
2. Review add-on logs for warnings
3. Restart the add-on
4. Consider reducing concurrent AI assistant operations
