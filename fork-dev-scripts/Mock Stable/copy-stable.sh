# Copy the stable add-on flavour over the dev add-on directory so
# `homeassistant-addon-dev/` builds and runs as the stable add-on.
#
# Why this exists: the fork-dev add-on (`homeassistant-addon-dev/`) is
# the only deployment path some maintainers have available for local
# Home Assistant testing — they can't install the real stable add-on
# alongside it. This script overwrites the dev directory with the
# stable directory's contents so a single `git push addon-repo`
# delivers a stable-flavored build under the fork-dev slug.
#
# What it does:
#   - Replaces every shared file (config.yaml, DOCS.md, Dockerfile,
#     start.py, README.md, translations/, CHANGELOG.md) in
#     `homeassistant-addon-dev/` with the stable copy.
#   - Patches the copied `config.yaml` to keep the dev add-on's
#     identity so Home Assistant Supervisor doesn't collide with the
#     real stable add-on:
#       * name  → "Home Assistant MCP Server (Fork-Dev Stable Test)"
#       * slug  → "ha_mcp_dev"
#       * version → "<stable>-stable-test"
#       * removes the prebuilt `image:` line so Supervisor builds the
#         image locally from the source the fork-dev branch ships
#         (the real stable image is pinned to upstream's container
#         registry and can't be reused here)
#       * adds the dev ingress lines back so the web UI keeps working
#   - Patches the copied `Dockerfile` LABEL so the dev tag appears in
#     `docker inspect` output.
#   - Writes `homeassistant-addon-dev/.stable-flavor` as a marker so
#     `restore-dev.sh` (and the maintainer) can see which flavour is
#     currently staged.
#
# Run from the repo root. To revert, run `fork-dev-scripts/Mock\ Stable/restore-dev.sh`.

✔ Staged stable flavor into $DST/.
  Next:
    1. Review the diff:  git diff --stat $DST
    2. Bump the version in $DST/config.yaml if needed (current value
       has '-stable-test' appended so HA recognises it as a new build).
    3. Commit + push to addon-repo so HA Supervisor pulls it.
