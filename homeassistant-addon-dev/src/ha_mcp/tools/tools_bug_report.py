        2. **Agent Behavior Feedback** - For AI agent inefficiency, wrong tool usage

        **IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS:**
        You MUST analyze the conversation context to determine which template to present:

        🐛 **Present RUNTIME BUG template if:**
           - User reports an error, failure, or unexpected behavior
           - A tool returned an error or incorrect result
           - Something is broken or not working in ha-mcp

        🤖 **Present AGENT BEHAVIOR template if:**
           - User mentions YOU (the agent) used the wrong tool
           - User suggests a more efficient workflow
           - User reports YOUR inefficiency or mistakes
           - User says you should have done something differently

        **If unclear which type, ASK the user:**
        "Are you reporting a bug in ha-mcp, or providing feedback on how I used the tools?"

        **WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:**
        - "I want to file a bug/issue/report"
        - "This isn't working"
        - "You should have used [other tool]"
        - "That was inefficient"

        **OUTPUT:**
        Returns both templates plus diagnostic data. Key fields:
        - `runtime_bug_template`, `agent_behavior_template` — pick based on context
        - `recent_logs`, `startup_logs` — captured ha-mcp tool/server log entries
        - `addon_logs` — addon container stdout/stderr (HA add-on installs only;

## 💡 Suggested Improvement

<!-- How could the agent be improved? Options: -->

- [ ] **Tool documentation** - Tool description or examples need clarification
- [ ] **Error messages** - Tool should return better guidance on failure
- [ ] **Tool design** - Tool should accept different parameters or return more info
- [ ] **Agent prompting** - System prompt should guide agent differently
- [ ] **New tool needed** - Missing functionality requires a new tool
- [ ] **Other** - Describe below

**Details:**
<!-- Explain your suggestion -->

## 📊 Environment

- **ha-mcp Version:** {diagnostic_info.get("ha_mcp_version", "Unknown")}
- **Installation Method:** {diagnostic_info.get("installation_method", "Unknown")}
- **MCP Transport:** {mcp_transport} _(auto-detected — correct if wrong)_
- **MCP Client:** {_format_client_info_for_template(client_info)} _(auto-detected from the MCP `initialize` handshake)_
- **AI Model:**
- **Home Assistant Version:** {diagnostic_info.get("home_assistant_version", "Unknown")}

## ⚙️ ha-mcp Configuration

These flags shape which tools the agent sees, so the same behavior may be
expected vs. surprising depending on toggle state:

{config_toggles_section}

## 📎 Additional Context

<!-- Screenshots, conversation logs, or other helpful info -->

**Note:** This is for improving AI agent behavior. For ha-mcp bugs (errors, crashes), use the Runtime Bug template instead.

    return """## Anonymization Guide

Before submitting your bug report, please review and anonymize:

### MUST ANONYMIZE (security-sensitive):
- API tokens, passwords, secrets -> Replace with "[REDACTED]"
- IP addresses (internal/external) -> Replace with "192.168.x.x" or "[IP]"
- MAC addresses -> Replace with "[MAC]"
- Email addresses -> Replace with "user@example.com"
- Phone numbers -> Replace with "[PHONE]"

### CONSIDER ANONYMIZING (privacy-sensitive):
- Location names (city, address) -> Replace with generic names like "Home" or "[LOCATION]"
- Device names that reveal personal info -> Replace with "Device 1", "Light 1", etc.
- Person names in entity IDs -> Replace with "person.user1"
- Calendar/todo items with personal details -> Summarize without specifics

### KEEP AS-IS (helpful for debugging):
- Entity domains (light, switch, sensor, etc.)
- Device types and capabilities
- Automation/script structure (triggers, conditions, actions)
- Error messages (but check for secrets in them)
- Timestamps and durations
- State values (on/off, numeric values, etc.)
- Home Assistant and ha-mcp versions

### Example anonymization:
BEFORE: "light.juliens_bedroom" with token "eyJhbG..."
AFTER:  "light.bedroom_1" with token "[REDACTED]"

The goal is to preserve enough detail to reproduce and fix the bug
while protecting your personal information and security.
