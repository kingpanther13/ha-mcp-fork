"""Real e2e tests for Read Only Mode (#1569).

Boots a fresh in-process ha-mcp server with ``READ_ONLY_MODE=true``
against the testcontainer HA (function-scoped — the session-scoped
``mcp_client`` boots without the flag) and verifies the full contract:

- write-capable tools disappear from ``tools/list``;
- pure read tools keep working;
- exempt mixed read/write tools stay listed, their read actions work,
  and their write actions return the structured READ_ONLY_MODE error;
- direct calls to hidden write tools return the same error;
- with tool search enabled, proxy-dispatched writes are blocked too, and
  only the read proxy is listed;
- ``ha_get_overview`` reports the mode to the LLM;
- the real catalog satisfies the invariant that every mandatory tool is
  either read-safe or exempt (a unit test cannot see the real registered
  catalog, so this real-catalog check lives in the e2e suite).

Requires Docker (testcontainers); runs in CI.

    """Read-only mode on the REAL inaddon add-on (every test above skips inaddon
    via ``_build_readonly_server``, which can only inject ``READ_ONLY_MODE`` into
    a fresh in-process server).

    Enables read_only_mode through the add-on's OWN settings API — which merges it
    into the Supervisor add-on options the production way (a bare options POST is
    full-replacement and would drop required keys) — self-restarts ONLY the add-on
    (~10s; Home Assistant is untouched) so it boots with ``READ_ONLY_MODE=true``,
    asserts ha_manage_radio's read action still works while a write is blocked with
    the structured READ_ONLY_MODE error, then RESTORES read-only to off.

    xdist runs a worker's tests serially and each worker owns an isolated add-on
    (``_haos_worker_setup``), so bracketing read-only around just this test and
    restoring it in ``finally`` is safe at any position. (Ordering tricks do NOT
    help — ``--dist loadscope`` groups tests by module, so a single "run last"
    marker can't make this the last thing on its worker.) The two dev-add-on
    restarts also drop the SHARED session ``mcp_client`` connection
    (test_supervisor_inaddon.py documents that restarting the dev add-on kills
    mcp_client for later tests), so the ``finally`` also warms that client back up
    so whatever module loadscope hands this worker next gets a live session.
