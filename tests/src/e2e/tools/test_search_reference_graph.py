"""E2E contract test for the ``search/related`` reference-graph merge.

Discussion #2258. The unit tests around this feature drive a mocked client, so
every one of them asserts against a response shape this repo *assumed* Home
Assistant produces. That assumption is load-bearing and non-obvious: HA's
``Searcher.async_search`` returns ``dict[ItemType, set[str]]``, and what
reaches the wire depends on its JSON encoder coercing those sets to arrays.

If the real shape differs, every unit test still passes and ``ha_search``
silently reports nothing from the graph. Silent is the operative word: the
feature exists to answer "what breaks if I rename this entity", so a false
negative reads as "nothing uses it" and makes an unsafe rename look safe.

One test, against a real Home Assistant, closes exactly that gap. It pins the
command name, its parameters, the envelope parsing, and the item-type-to-bucket
mapping in a single pass. Everything else about the merge is pure logic already
covered by ``tests/src/unit/test_search_related_graph.py``.

The public search now serves complete windows through the component. This
contract test invokes the legacy search implementation with the real HA
client, so it proves HA's reference-graph wire shape without relying on a
result limit to force a particular public route. The same fixture verifies
that public component search still discovers the automation.
