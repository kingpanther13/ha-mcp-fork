"""``ha_search`` split route: component ``search`` + dashboards leg, merged.

Naming ``dashboard`` in ``search_types`` used to send the WHOLE call to the
legacy path, so the automation/script/scene/helper surfaces lost the
component's in-process scan and went back to one REST fetch per config —
~94 seconds and ``partial`` on a 136-automation instance versus 62ms complete
for the same call without ``dashboard`` (issue #2289).

These tests pin the split: the component's ``search`` command serves the
surfaces it has, the component's separate ``ha_mcp_tools/dashboards``
doc-search frame serves the dashboard bucket, and the server merges the two
into one score-sorted page. The corner cases (a request the component search
could not serve at all, a page deeper than the component's ``limit`` ceiling,
either leg failing) are pinned here too, because each of them decides between
a merged response and the legacy path.
