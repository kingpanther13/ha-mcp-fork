# Statistics and Energy Dashboard inspection

`ha_get_history(source="statistics")` reads recorder values and
`recorder/get_statistics_metadata` from the connected Home Assistant.
`unit_of_measurement` is Core's **display unit**, the unit Core uses for the
returned numbers with its default conversion. `statistics_metadata` preserves
Core's response, including `statistics_unit_of_measurement`,
`display_unit_of_measurement`, `unit_class`, and aggregation capabilities.
The stored unit can differ from the output unit.

`unit_source="recorder_metadata"` identifies a resolved unit. Missing or
unavailable metadata leaves the output unit null with `unit_source="unknown"`,
a `unit_reason`, and a warning. Metadata reporting a genuinely unitless
statistic is distinguished by `unit_reason="statistics_are_unitless"`.
Current entity attributes are never silently substituted for recorder metadata.
Metadata is independent of pagination, including empty pages. Core's row fields,
including interval end timestamps, are preserved.

To discover the statistics configured in the Energy Dashboard, call
`ha_manage_energy_prefs(mode="get", include_statistics=True)`. Its
`statistics_metadata` lists the referenced source, device, cost, and rate
statistics and their metadata. Missing references have explicit reasons.
This inspection does not change preferences or their configuration hashes.
Pass a returned statistic ID to `ha_get_history` to retrieve its readings.

Neither path requires the custom component. Both use the running Core's native
recorder API, including Core's handling of statistics without a current entity.
The history tool currently follows Core's default display conversion; it does
not offer an explicit output-unit override.

## Native request options and schema discovery

`include_schema=True` on `ha_get_history`, or on energy `mode="get"`, includes
the running Core's contract when the component supports discovery. Descriptions
can be incomplete for callable validators; energy dry runs still invoke the
actual registered save schema. Without the capability, previews explicitly
report `proposal_validation.status="unavailable"` and `partial=True`.

Statistics types go directly to Core, including `last_reset` and future types.
Omitting them uses Core's defaults; the response reports types observed in the
returned rows. `core_options` passes additional native recorder options, such
as `{"units": {"energy": "MWh"}}`. It cannot override the tool's controlled
query fields. Explicit-unit labels use Core's converter through the component;
without it, values are preserved and units are explicitly unknown.

History responses retain native row fields beside the readable aliases.
Energy saves return the normalized Core configuration and hashes calculated
from it. Preferences and per-key hashes retain future top-level fields.
On an unconfigured installation without the component, `config` is empty
instead of fabricated defaults; use its full `config_hash` for the first save.

Energy `current_state_validation` and `post_save_validation` preserve native
semantic validation results. These checks concern persisted state, whereas
proposal validation checks the save schema without writing.
