# Live dev environment

`.github/workflows/dev-ha-env.yml` runs a throwaway Home Assistant on a GitHub
runner and exposes it, plus your branch's ha-mcp server, through temporary
Cloudflare tunnels. Use it to drive a branch against a real HA without Docker
and without touching your own instance. It boots HA with the E2E suite's own
bring-up and config (user `mcp` / `mcp`, token `TEST_TOKEN` in
`tests/test_constants.py`). It is separate from the test suite: nothing in CI
runs it, and its runner script (`.github/dev-ha-env/hold.py`) is copied into
the tracked branch's E2E directory only for the run.

| `platform` | `server` | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| `docker` | `standalone` | HA container; your branch's server runs on the runner |
| `docker` | `embedded` | HA container; the server runs inside the component |
| `haos` | `standalone` | HAOS VM; your branch's server runs on the runner |
| `haos` | `embedded` | HAOS VM; the server runs inside the component |
| `haos` | `app` | HAOS VM; the server runs as the app (add-on) |

`no_component=true` removes the component's File & YAML Tools entry, like the
no-tools E2E lanes. `strict_bps` (default on, as agents meet it) sets strict
best-practices mode for the standalone and embedded servers. `ha_image`
overrides the Docker image (default: `ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable`).
Pass an explicit version tag to test an older Core release, or `:beta` to test
the current beta. This dev default is independent of the branch's E2E pin. `minutes`
defaults to and is capped at 330. A HAOS run builds the HAOS image the first
time the image build files, the test config or the proxy app change, and saves
it to the fork's cache for later runs. A branch whose component differs from
every cached image reuses one with the same base and applies its own component
at boot with a Core restart, the way a pushed commit is applied.

Run it **from your fork only**. The job refuses to run in
`homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp`, whose runners are shared CI capacity.

1. Enable Actions on your fork and sync its `master`, since GitHub only
   dispatches workflows that exist on the default branch.
2. Make a throwaway key pair for this run. The tunnel URLs are published
   only encrypted to its public key, so nothing secret goes to GitHub and
   any machine can start a run:
   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out devenv-key.pem
   ```
3. Start it against any branch of your fork, passing the public key:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run dev-ha-env.yml -R <you>/ha-mcp -f track_ref=<branch> \
     -f platform=haos -f server=app \
     -f public_key="$(openssl pkey -in devenv-key.pem -pubout | openssl base64 -A)"
   ```
4. Once the run reaches "Keep running", download and decrypt the URLs:
   ```bash
   gh run download <run-id> -R <you>/ha-mcp -n dev-ha-env-urls
   openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey devenv-key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:oaep -in dev-ha-env-urls.enc
   ```
   `HA:` is the HA UI and API. `MCP:` is your branch's server (streamable
   HTTP, path included), ready to add to an MCP client.

   Test through `MCP:`, the way an agent uses the server: add it to your
   client as a regular MCP server, or, when the agent's client cannot load a
   new server mid-session, have the agent build a small shim that sends
   `tools/list` and `tools/call` to that URL and drive it one call at a time.
   Do the setup and the checks with the tools as well. Creating or verifying
   state through `HA:`'s REST API routes around the tools under test, so a
   gap in them goes unnoticed.
5. Push to the branch to iterate. Every 20 seconds the runner picks up new
   commits and applies them the way a user's update would:
   - A server change restarts the standalone server. The embedded server gets
     a wheel built from the commit, as `ha_dev_manage_server(update_source)`
     installs one. The app gets a version-bumped source and Supervisor's app
     update.
   - A change under `custom_components/ha_mcp_tools/` replaces the component,
     as HACS does, and restarts Home Assistant.

   The job log's `STATUS` lines show the running commit and any update error.
   An embedded server that fails to come up at boot is reported there too;
   Home Assistant stays up, so push the fix to the branch.

   The instance is a normal HA you can change. On HAOS, change the Core
   version from Settings → System → Updates, or run
   `ha core update --version 2026.10.0` in the Advanced SSH app's terminal;
   apps, integrations and the component install and uninstall as usual. Docker
   HA has no update mechanism, so start the same run again with another
   `ha_image`; the new run replaces the old one.
6. **Cancel the run when you're done.** It does not stop on its own until
   `minutes` runs out, and it holds a runner the whole time:
   ```bash
   gh run cancel <run-id> -R <you>/ha-mcp
   ```

Anyone who has a tunnel URL has admin on that instance through the public test
credentials. Don't share the URLs, and don't put anything real in it.
