# Hourly Renovate and HA Release Coverage Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task in this session. Track progress with checkboxes. Do not delegate unless separately authorized.

**Goal:** Fix Renovate first: refresh the dependency dashboard hourly and promptly propose stable Home Assistant Core, Supervisor, and HAOS updates while preserving other dependencies' existing protections and explicit manual overrides; then complete beta HAOS coverage.

**Architecture:** Keep one full-repository Renovate scan, with exact package rules separating HA release updates from ordinary dependencies. Add a guarded dashboard-edit trigger for manual requests and Renovate-readable stable image inputs; beta lanes independently resolve all three components from the upstream beta channel and key their images on those versions.

**Tech Stack:** GitHub Actions YAML, Renovate 44.50.1 JSON configuration and custom regex/datasource managers, Python HAOS image builder, pytest workflow-contract and live HAOS tests.

**Spec:** The approved in-chat design and the complete session requirements transcribed below are the specification. The user approved implementation and explicitly requested this persistent plan on 2026-09-06. No additional design approval is needed for the scope below.

## Global constraints

- Renovate correctness is primary. Beta HAOS is secondary, but remains required in the same requested PR.
- Stable HA Core, Supervisor, and HAOS updates must have no seven-day age delay and no Tuesday scheduling delay. Immediate means the next successful hourly scan, or an explicit earlier scan; GitHub scheduled execution and upstream publication can introduce latency.
- Ordinary dependencies retain the existing seven-day release-age policy and Tuesday-after-15:00-UTC automatic update window. Preserve existing timestamp-optional behavior and security-update exceptions; do not silently tighten or weaken those policies.
- Scanning ordinary dependencies hourly is permitted. It must not create or update ordinary dependency PRs outside their schedule except through existing explicit overrides/security policy.
- Human dashboard approval/rebase requests must remain effective and be processed promptly. A manual workflow dispatch runs a scan; it does not globally force ordinary dependencies past their policy.
- Stable lanes consume stable releases; beta lanes consume the latest version listed in beta metadata, including when beta currently equals stable. Do not assume every patch release had an advance beta soak.
- Preserve environment overrides and Supervisor self-update behavior; a tracked Supervisor minimum is not a freeze or downgrade requirement.
- Preserve existing beta triggers, lane topology, sole cache writer, manual forced runs, and PR coverage boundaries unless a scoped correctness fix requires a change.
- Use the existing isolated worktree and preserve unrelated work. Open a draft PR only; no merge, ready transition, releases, or branch deletion is authorized.
- Before every further push, wait for the current head’s fast CI lanes to finish (Fast Checks, Unit Tests, CodeQL, Renovate validation, site, version/changes gates, and Docker/app validation). E2E/performance runs are not the push gate. Wait for the first bot review and bundle verified fixes into the next push. Do not cancel CI.
- Local execution is limited to CodeQL, mypy, Ruff format, and lightweight unit tests in proot, as explicitly authorized on 2026-09-06. All heavier tests/builds/E2E run in GitHub CI. Do not describe unrun tests as passing.

## Prompt-by-prompt scope audit

All nine earlier task prompts were reread verbatim from this session's raw transcript on 2026-09-06, not inferred solely from a compaction summary. Times below are UTC. This section preserves the requirements in normalized spelling, not as direct quotations.

| Prompt | Required outcome | Covered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12:25:07 — Investigate hamcp Renovate, stale 2026.9 dashboard entry, current stable 2026.9.1, instant E2E image updates, latest beta | Establish actual triggers, dashboard and running-image state; remove HA update delays; align stable pins and preserve beta resolution | Tasks 1–3, 5 |
| 12:30:07 — Patch releases may not have a separate beta; at least stable/main E2E should have 2026.9.1 pending | Do not depend on beta precoverage for prompt stable updates; catch up current stable Core consumers | Tasks 2–3 |
| 12:59:15 — Make a PR for hourly scans, stale-dashboard fix, immediate Core/Supervisor updates, seven days for everything else | One draft PR; hourly scan plus narrowly scoped immediate-HA policy | Tasks 1–2, 5 |
| 13:00:19 — Other dependencies may be scanned if dashboard-only outside their normal policy | Preserve ordinary creation and branch-update scheduling while refreshing discovery | Tasks 1–2 |
| 13:01:20 — Supervisor releases exist; verify whether Dependabot or Renovate handles them | Verify actual ownership and runtime self-update, then add missing explicit Renovate tracking | Tasks 1, 3 |
| 13:02:33 — Manual overrides always respected; checked box had waited 17 hours without PRs | Trigger a guarded scan on human dashboard body edits and verify checked requests bypass intended gates | Tasks 1–2, 5 |
| 13:04:47 — Track Supervisor, immediate stable PRs, beta Supervisor remains in beta lanes | Stable-channel datasource and image minimum pin; beta override preserved | Tasks 2–4 |
| 13:05:22 — HAOS itself gets the same treatment | Stable HAOS dependency also receives immediate Renovate PRs and rebuilds stable images | Tasks 2–3 |
| 13:07:00 — Beta HAOS should load in beta lanes too | Resolve beta OS, download that image, include OS in cache and skip decisions, attest running OS | Task 4 |

Latest instruction: continue until the draft PR exists; do not stop after planning or request repeat approval. Keep Renovate primary, include every requirement above, and persist progress here. Local execution is limited as specified above.

## Implementation checkpoint

- Implemented hourly scans, the guarded human dashboard-edit trigger, writer serialization, and single repository-config loading.
- Implemented immediate rules for precisely Core/Supervisor/HAOS; ordinary Tuesday/seven-day policy remains in place with off-schedule branch updates disabled.
- Implemented the stable Supervisor datasource and real stable image inputs; aligned all five Core pins to freshly verified 2026.9.1.
- Implemented beta OS resolution, download override, cache key, three-component skip decision, and live OS attestation.
- Added a credential-free CI workflow to validate configuration with the scanner's pinned Renovate engine. Full Renovate behavior has not been executed locally; production dashboard cleanup still requires the deployed workflow's next scan.
- Regression evidence: before the image/beta implementation, focused tests reported 11 failures and 3 passes; the missing OS-only-beta behavior was reproduced. After implementation, release-input, workflow-contract, and Renovate-extraction/policy tests passed (23 tests) in proot.
- Expanded focused run including Supervisor readiness tests passed: 79 tests in 35.82 seconds. Ruff format completed on the eight changed Python files.
- Draft PR: https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/pull/2379, targeting master. Initial implementation commit: `309eeb85eada12c9112f293fafcb6ff99a100fc1`. All six stable HAOS lanes and container CI started; automated reviews started without extra requests.
- First CI validator run succeeded, but its log showed explicit filenames default to global validation. Corrected to `--no-global`; repository-mode validation then passed at `8d81fe0c`. All fast CI lanes at that head subsequently passed.
- First Codex review identified missing behavioral coverage for the policy and dashboard guard. The next bundled push adds fixtures using the pinned Renovate package’s actual rule/schedule/age/limit functions, GitHub’s expression evaluator for nine event cases, and a credential-free Supervisor datasource lookup. These new CI fixtures are not locally executed under the user’s execution limits. Full E2E/review remains in progress; the live scanner is not deployed yet.

## Resume state and investigation evidence

- Worktree: `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/ha-mcp/worktree/renovate-hourly-ha`.
- Branch: `fix/renovate-hourly-ha`; starting fetched `origin/master`: `70ec6c109d29dc140090e46076cf4c78cf17be6c`.
- Upstream: `homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp`; push remote: `kingpanther13/ha-mcp-fork`.
- Before this plan, only `.github/workflows/renovate.yml` and `renovate.json` were modified. Those changes are draft implementation, not validated completion. No commit, push, or PR exists yet.
- Root `AGENTS.md`, applicable tests guidance, development/workflow references, and `SECURITY.md` were read during investigation. Re-read applicable guidance when resuming changes to those areas.
- The original workflow ran Tuesday at 15:00 UTC or by manual dispatch; it did not react to dashboard edits. The repository already exempted Core from release age and schedule, but exemption did not cause scans to run.
- [Renovate run 33871075811](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/actions/runs/33871075811) was the last observed run. It predated the current Core pin/schedule correction and logged a 2026.8.3 → 2026.9.0 update as not scheduled.
- [Dashboard #1237](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/issues/1237) contained stale Core data and checked manual requests. Its verified author is `ha-mcp-renovate[bot]`. Passing `renovate.json` as both action-global and normally discovered repository config duplicated custom-manager discovery.
- At investigation, the four container/test defaults were 2026.9.0. [Stable container run 34030642588](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/actions/runs/34030642588) used 2026.9.0; [beta container run 34030642504](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/actions/runs/34030642504) used 2026.9.1.
- [Stable metadata](https://version.home-assistant.io/stable.json) then listed Core 2026.9.1, Supervisor 2026.08.0, HAOS OVA 18.2. [Beta metadata](https://version.home-assistant.io/beta.json) listed Core 2026.9.1, Supervisor 2026.09.0, HAOS OVA 18.2. Refresh these before choosing final pins; they are dated observations.
- Supervisor already self-updates to its configured channel at boot; runtime explicitly waits for that update to settle. [Stable HAOS run 34028070701](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/actions/runs/34028070701) reported Supervisor 2026.08.0 and Core 2026.9.1. Do not repeat the earlier incorrect inference that Supervisor necessarily remains frozen in a cached image.
- Dependabot handles GitHub Actions and uv, not Supervisor. Renovate already tracks stable HAOS releases; Supervisor lacks a tracked stable pin.
- Beta HAOS workflow currently resolves Core/Supervisor only, so its OS stays on the stable image-builder pin. Actual OS prerelease tags include `18.2.rc1`, with a dot before `rc`.

## Task 1: Finish diagnosis and make Renovate scans timely

**Files:** `.github/workflows/renovate.yml`; `docs/agents/github-workflow.md`; new focused `tests/src/unit/test_renovate_workflow_shape.py`.

**Interface:** Schedule/manual/dashboard events start a serialized repository scan. Repository configuration is loaded once. Issue body contents never become executable commands or configuration.

- [x] Inspect actual workflow, dashboard, previous run logs, stable/beta metadata, historical Supervisor behavior, and Dependabot ownership.
- [x] Refresh the exact master head, dashboard body and open dependency PRs before final implementation so any new runs or human changes are preserved.
- [x] Finish the existing hourly trigger draft and retain workflow dispatch:

  ```yaml
  schedule:
    - cron: '17 * * * *'
  issues:
    types: [edited]
  ```

- [x] Gate issue-triggered jobs to edits of the real Renovate dashboard authored by `ha-mcp-renovate[bot]`, a non-bot sender, a changed body, and a checked request. Exclude unrelated issue edits and Renovate's own edits. Keep event data out of shell interpolation.
- [x] Serialize Renovate writers with job-level `concurrency` and `cancel-in-progress: false`; preserve the existing app-token permission boundary.
- [ ] Remove `configurationFile: renovate.json` from the action input and let normal repository discovery load it once. Verify custom manager extraction and dashboard entries are no longer duplicated in a non-mutating Renovate run.
- [ ] Add regression coverage for hourly cadence, preserved dispatch, issue guard, and single configuration loading. A representative contract assertion is:

  ```python
  assert workflow["on"]["schedule"] == [{"cron": "17 * * * *"}]
  assert "workflow_dispatch" in workflow["on"]
  assert workflow["on"]["issues"]["types"] == ["edited"]
  assert "configurationFile" not in renovate_step["with"]
  ```

- [ ] Record expected event cases: human checked dashboard edit runs; bot edit does not; unrelated issue edit does not; unchecked edit does not; manual dispatch runs. Verify guards beyond simple string presence through event-expression evaluation where available.
- [x] Document scan cadence versus PR policy and explain why checked requests previously waited for the next scheduled scan.

## Task 2: Prove the HA exception and ordinary-dependency protections

**Files:** `renovate.json`; `tests/src/unit/test_renovate_workflow_shape.py`; `docs/agents/github-workflow.md`.

**Interface:** Exact dependency names select the immediate-release policy; other packages retain inherited ordinary policy. Manual dashboard instructions remain Renovate-native overrides.

- [x] Keep global `minimumReleaseAge: "7 days"`, `minimumReleaseAgeBehaviour: "timestamp-optional"`, UTC Tuesday schedule, and existing vulnerability exception. Set `updateNotScheduled: false` so hourly scans do not churn ordinary PR branches outside their window.
- [x] Finish the immediate rule, restricted to precisely these dependencies:

  ```json
  {
    "matchDepNames": [
      "ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant",
      "home-assistant/supervisor",
      "home-assistant/operating-system"
    ],
    "minimumReleaseAge": null,
    "schedule": ["at any time"],
    "prCreation": "immediate",
    "prHourlyLimit": 0,
    "prConcurrentLimit": 0
  }
  ```

- [x] Confirm inherited branch/PR caps cannot delay those HA updates and later package rules do not override this exception. Keep stable selection free of prereleases.
- [ ] Validate against the pinned Renovate engine/schema and use a non-mutating dry run or equivalent controlled fixture to exercise the following decision table. Configuration shape alone is not proof of scheduling behavior.

  | Case | Expected result |
  | --- | --- |
  | Stable Core/Supervisor/OS release younger than seven days, outside Tuesday window | Update eligible immediately |
  | Ordinary release younger than seven days, inside Tuesday window, no override | Age gate preserved |
  | Ordinary mature release outside Tuesday window, no override | Dashboard discovery only; no new or updated PR branch |
  | Ordinary mature release inside Tuesday window | Normal update eligible |
  | Explicit checked dashboard request outside normal gates | Renovate processes the requested override |
  | Hourly scan or manual workflow dispatch without checked overrides | No blanket schedule/age bypass |

- [x] Verify the checked create-all-awaiting-schedule and individual approval/rebase request paths against Renovate 44.50.1. Do not delete checked requests, disable dashboard approvals, or add a global forced schedule override.

## Task 3: Track stable image inputs and catch up Core

**Files:** `tests/haos_image_build/build_image.py`; `tests/haos_image_build/README.md`; `.github/workflows/pr.yml`; `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`; `.github/workflows/performance-tests.yml`; `tests/test_constants.py`; `renovate.json`; focused builder/manager tests.

**Interface:** Renovate updates concrete stable literals used by actual builds. Existing `HAOS_BUILD_*` environment variables override those defaults. Changes to the builder invalidate the existing stable image cache key.

- [x] Add a stable-channel Supervisor datasource using authoritative promotion metadata, not an inference from the latest GitHub release:

  ```json
  "ha-supervisor-stable": {
    "defaultRegistryUrlTemplate": "https://version.home-assistant.io/stable.json",
    "format": "json",
    "transformTemplates": [
      "{\"releases\": [{\"version\": supervisor}], \"sourceUrl\": \"https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor\"}"
    ]
  }
  ```

- [x] Use Supervisor calendar versioning `regex:^(?<major>\\d{4})\\.(?<minor>\\d{1,2})\\.(?<patch>\\d+)$` so zero-padded monthly versions compare correctly.
- [x] Add real builder defaults, with refreshed stable versions at implementation time:

  ```python
  # renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=home-assistant/operating-system
  STABLE_HAOS_VERSION = "18.2"
  # renovate: datasource=custom.ha-supervisor-stable depName=home-assistant/supervisor
  STABLE_SUPERVISOR_VERSION = "2026.08.0"
  # renovate: datasource=docker depName=ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant
  STABLE_CORE_VERSION = "2026.9.1"

  HAOS_VERSION = os.environ.get("HAOS_BUILD_OS_VERSION", STABLE_HAOS_VERSION)
  SUPERVISOR_CHANNEL = os.environ.get("HAOS_BUILD_SUPERVISOR_CHANNEL", "stable")
  SUPERVISOR_MIN_VERSION = os.environ.get(
      "HAOS_BUILD_SUPERVISOR_MIN_VERSION", STABLE_SUPERVISOR_VERSION
  )
  CORE_VERSION = os.environ.get("HAOS_BUILD_CORE_VERSION", STABLE_CORE_VERSION)
  ```

- [x] Define `HAOS_VERSION` before constructing its download URL. Ensure existing Supervisor/Core configuration functions consume the defaults, and make their beta-specific log messages generic where now used by stable builds. Preserve newer Supervisor versions rather than forcing a downgrade.
- [x] Align the four existing Core image pins and the new HAOS Core pin to current stable (2026.9.1 at investigation). Do not alter unrelated frozen-version test fixtures merely because their example contains 2026.9.0.
- [ ] Verify regex managers extract every intended pin exactly once; verify datasource transformation emits only the promoted stable Supervisor; verify beta/dev Supervisor versions are excluded from stable PR selection.
- [x] Confirm stable cache invalidation and all stable HAOS consumers rebuild/restore images keyed on the changed builder inputs. Do not introduce a marker pin that is unused by the running build.
- [x] Cover no-override stable defaults and explicit beta overrides in builder tests; assert the OS override is reflected in the actual download URL and the existing build workflow can still read `HAOS_VERSION`.
- [x] Update the image-builder README to describe all stable pins, environment overrides, cache invalidation, and the distinction between a Supervisor minimum and automatic channel self-updates.

## Task 4: Complete beta OS coverage without disturbing the Renovate fix

**Files:** `.github/workflows/haos-e2e-beta-tests.yml`; `tests/haos_image_build/build_image.py`; `tests/src/unit/test_haos_image_workflow_shape.py`; `tests/src/e2e/conftest.py`; `tests/src/e2e/haos_only/test_canary_addons.py`; `tests/haos_image_build/README.md`.

**Interface:** Each beta resolver emits `os_version`, `supervisor_version`, and `core_version`. Build uses `HAOS_BUILD_OS_VERSION`; live attestation uses `HAOS_EXPECTED_OS_VERSION`.

- [x] Extend both lane resolvers to read `metadata["hassos"]["ova"]`, validate stable and prerelease OS formats with `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+([.]rc[0-9]+)?$`, and output `os_version` alongside the existing two outputs. Missing, malformed, or failed metadata must fail visibly rather than falsely skip coverage.
- [x] Extend the initial stable-versus-beta comparison to compare all three versions. Only when OS, Supervisor, and Core all match may automatic beta runs be skipped; manual dispatch still runs.
- [x] Include OS in the identical cache key used by both lanes:

  ```text
  haos-beta-image-${{ steps.versions.outputs.os_version }}-${{ steps.versions.outputs.supervisor_version }}-${{ steps.versions.outputs.core_version }}-$hash
  ```

- [x] Add `HAOS_BUILD_OS_VERSION: ${{ steps.versions.outputs.os_version }}` to both builds and preserve the existing beta Supervisor channel/minimum and exact Core overrides. Validate OS values before they become URL/path components.
- [x] Add `HAOS_EXPECTED_OS_VERSION` to both test environments and to beta-attestation marker setup. Extend `test_beta_image_versions_match_manifest` to query the running VM through the existing Supervisor WebSocket proxy:

  ```python
  response = await ha_client.send_websocket_message(
      {"type": "supervisor/api", "endpoint": "/os/info", "method": "GET"}
  )
  assert response.get("success"), response
  assert response["result"]["version"] == os.environ["HAOS_EXPECTED_OS_VERSION"]
  ```

- [x] Update existing workflow-contract tests for the third output, six individually checked channel reads, OS-aware cache key, new build environment, and expected OS version. Preserve the in-app lane as sole cache writer.
- [x] Add behavioral comparison fixtures: all equal → skip; OS-only `18.2.rc1` difference → run; Supervisor-only difference → run; Core-only difference → run; missing/invalid OS → fail. Use mocked metadata, not live release values, so the regression tests remain stable.
- [x] Confirm the OS currently being identical across channels does not hide the new path: CI must cover an OS-only beta fixture even if real metadata has no OS beta today.

## Task 5: Verification, draft PR, and honest handoff

**Files:** Relevant changed files above, this plan, and `.github/pull_request_template.md` as the read-only PR-body template.

- [x] Self-audit the completed diff against every prompt row and decision-table case. Run `git diff --check` and inspect final branch/status before committing.
- [ ] Validate Renovate configuration and non-mutating behavior separately from Python workflow tests. Do not invoke the production Renovate writer from an unmerged implementation merely to test it.
- [x] Commit scoped changes on `fix/renovate-hourly-ha`, push the fork branch, and open one draft against `homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp:master`. Use the repository PR template and preserve all headings/generated sections.
- [ ] Inspect CI on the exact pushed head, including container and stable HAOS lanes. Inspect full automated/human review bodies after every push and fix verified findings within the approved scope. Do not manually request extra reviews or cancel CI.
- [ ] Validate beta workflow behavior at the PR head through an available scoped GitHub Actions path; beta lanes do not automatically run on pull requests. If that runtime verification cannot be performed before merge, explicitly distinguish unit/contract coverage from unexecuted beta runtime coverage; do not claim all beta E2E passed.
- [ ] Refresh dashboard/run/PR evidence at handoff. Separate what the draft changes guarantee from what is active on default branch: the new cron and issue trigger are not deployed until this PR is merged.
- [ ] Explain that a real post-merge scan is required to demonstrate cleanup of dashboard #1237 and creation/handling of remaining eligible updates. Do not merge or activate the change without further authorization.
- [ ] Update this plan's checkboxes and resume state with commit, draft PR link, exact tested head, CI/review outcomes, and any remaining verification gaps.

## Completion criteria

The implementation is ready for handoff only when the Renovate schedule, dashboard refresh, manual-request path, stable HA tracking, ordinary dependency protections, stable pin catch-up, and beta OS selection/cache/gate/attestation changes are all accounted for. A passing fast check alone is insufficient. Keep the PR draft and report any unexecuted deployment or runtime validation plainly.
