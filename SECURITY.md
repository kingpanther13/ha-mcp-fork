## Threat Model

Understanding what ha-mcp does and doesn't defend against helps you write
accurate reports and helps us triage quickly.

### MCP clients are trusted principals

An authenticated MCP client (one that has the secret URL or completed the OAuth
flow) is a **trusted principal**. ha-mcp does not attempt to defend against a
malicious or compromised MCP client — that is equivalent to defending against a
malicious user who has your Home Assistant long-lived access token.

Consequences:
- Prompt injection that reaches an MCP client is the **client's responsibility**
  to defend against. If the LLM embedded in a client is tricked into calling a
  tool it shouldn't, that is a client-side control issue, not a server-side
  vulnerability.
- `python_transform` expressions are treated as **trusted code from a trusted
  client**. The sandbox exists to prevent accidental mistakes (e.g. a runaway
  loop), not to sandbox an adversarial party. Additionally, `python_transform`
  only ever receives data that ha-mcp fetched from the HA API and
  JSON-deserialized — no Python callables can reach the expression's `config`
  variable through any normal MCP or HA API call. See
  [python_sandbox.py](src/ha_mcp/utils/python_sandbox.py) for the explicit
  "not a security boundary" note.

### Custom dashboard cards are the user's own code

To describe and check `custom:` cards, the `ha_mcp_tools` component runs the
JavaScript files the user registered as dashboard resources (`/hacsfiles/...`,
`/local/...`) in a QuickJS sandbox inside Home Assistant. ha-mcp installs no
card; it only runs cards the user chose to install, the same files their
browsers already run with a logged-in Home Assistant session. Deciding which
cards are safe to install is the user's responsibility. The sandbox exposes no
network, filesystem or process APIs, and caps each card's memory, file size and
run time to contain a broken card, not an adversarial one. The DOM library it
runs on (linkedom) is fetched from the npm registry at a pinned version and
checked against its integrity hash before use.

Inspection starts on the first relevant request, never at HA startup. QuickJS
is an optional, exact-version dependency installed through HA's requirements
manager under Core's constraints. An existing incompatible provider or
dependency conflict disables this advice without replacing the provider or
preventing the integration from loading. The shared `quickjs` module name
means `quickjs` and `quickjs-ng` must not be installed over each other.

### Local network is the trusted zone for standard mode

The HTTP entrypoint (`ha-mcp-web`) authenticates by URL-path
secrecy and is designed for loopback HTTP or LAN HTTP with a high-entropy
`MCP_SECRET_PATH`. Any peer that can reach the configured path is treated as
trusted — securing the local network is outside ha-mcp's scope.

On app (add-on) installs, ha-mcp additionally talks to the Supervisor REST
API at `http://supervisor` with the Supervisor-issued token. That transport
is the platform's contract, not a choice this project can harden: Supervisor
serves its API over plain HTTP only (`web.TCPSite(..., port=80)` in
`supervisor/api/__init__.py` — no TLS endpoint, no IPC socket), on the
internal `hassio` docker network that is not reachable from the LAN. The
isolation of that internal network is the boundary protecting the token, and
it is enforced by the Home Assistant OS platform, not by ha-mcp.

For internet-facing deployments use the OAuth entrypoint (`ha-mcp-oauth`) or,
for gating access behind an external identity provider instead of per-user HA
tokens, the OIDC entrypoint (`ha-mcp-oidc`; see [docs/oidc.md](docs/oidc.md)),
behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (see
[OAuth Mode](#oauth-mode--beta-warning) below). Deployment guidance:
[development reference → Docker](docs/agents/development.md#docker).

By default the HTTP entrypoints bind to `0.0.0.0` so they are reachable from
other machines on the LAN. To restrict to the local machine, set
`MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1` (or use `-p 127.0.0.1:8086:8086` at the Docker layer).

### Host/Origin validation (DNS-rebinding guard) is off by default

fastmcp ships a Host/Origin guard — a DNS-rebinding defense that only accepts
loopback `Host` headers and same-origin/loopback `Origin`s. ha-mcp defaults it
off (`FASTMCP_HTTP_HOST_ORIGIN_PROTECTION=false`) across its Streamable-HTTP
entry points (`ha-mcp-web`, `ha-mcp-oauth`, `ha-mcp-oidc`, the app (add-on), and the
in-process component server). The supported
deployment model — reverse proxies, tunnels (Cloudflare, Nabu Casa), and direct
LAN access — presents `Host` headers ha-mcp cannot enumerate, and the guard
would otherwise reject them with `421`/`403` (including the plain browser landing
page, a no-`Origin` navigation that still trips the `Host` check).

This does not change the boundary defined above. URL-path secrecy (standard
mode), the OAuth / Home Assistant session gates (OAuth and in-process modes),
and the external identity provider gate (OIDC mode) remain the authentication
boundary, and the local network is already the trusted zone — so the
DNS-rebinding class this guard addresses is out of scope regardless. A
DNS-rebinding attacker's browser still cannot reach the secret MCP path — only
the public OAuth/OIDC discovery documents at fixed well-known paths (in
standard/OAuth HTTP modes, the landing page shares the secret path) — and the
loopback settings sidecar enforces its own Host/Origin allow-list independent
of this setting.

Operators who front ha-mcp differently can re-enable the guard by setting
`FASTMCP_HTTP_HOST_ORIGIN_PROTECTION=true` and pinning
`FASTMCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `FASTMCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

### Standard mode is single-tenant

The secret-URL model (`ha-mcp-web`) assumes a single operator.
All MCP clients that share the same `MCP_SECRET_PATH` get identical access —
there is no per-client authorization or isolation. Reports that assume "client A
shouldn't be able to see client B's data" don't apply to standard mode; that
isolation model only exists in OAuth mode (scoped per HA token).

### ha-mcp does not add or restrict Home Assistant permissions

ha-mcp uses the long-lived access token the operator provides. That token's
permissions in Home Assistant are what they are. If the configured token is an
admin token, ha-mcp can perform admin-level operations. Reports stating "ha-mcp
can do X" where X is permitted by the configured token are not vulnerabilities —
they are the intended behavior. ha-mcp expects an administrator's token;
non-admin tokens are not officially supported but still work, with
limitations: admin-only operations fail. Home Assistant answers an
admin-only REST request from a non-admin with a 401 that `http.ban` counts
toward an IP ban, so ha-mcp refuses those locally and calls services over
WebSocket, where a refusal is not counted.
To limit what an agent can do, use ha-mcp's tool security policies or
disable tools rather than a non-admin token.

### Entity visibility enforce mode is best-effort concealment

The opt-in entity visibility filter's **enforce mode** (`"enforce": true`, see
the [Entity visibility filter FAQ](docs/FAQ.md#enforce-mode)) makes a hidden set
unreadable across ordinary tool reads: direct reads of a hidden entity are
refused with a generic not-found before the tool runs, and scannable content
reads (dashboards, templates, automations, traces, logs, files) that would
surface a hidden entity_id are refused on contact. Those enforced paths fail
closed when registry data cannot be loaded.

One shape-bounded exception preserves an allowed entity's state: JSON
`ha_get_state` results omit fields, mapping keys, list items, or related records
that name a hidden entity and add a warning listing the omitted JSON paths. An
entity's whole `attributes` mapping is omitted when any of its content names a
hidden entity, because attribute values derive from the related entity (a
person's coordinates come from its device trackers) even where they do not name
it. The result is scanned again after filtering; non-JSON output, a shape that
cannot carry the warning, or any surviving hidden reference is refused. Direct
requests for the hidden related entity remain concealed before execution.

The warning necessarily discloses that the allowed result contained at least one
hidden-entity reference and which paths were omitted. It does not name the hidden
entity (a hidden mapping key is reported as `<hidden key>`) or reveal the omitted
values.

One diagnostic path is deliberately outside that guarantee by default:
`ha_report_issue` bypasses both scans while `restrict_report_issue` is false,
even when visibility data is healthy, and its report may contain logs naming a
hidden entity. This is the troubleshooting escape hatch when the filter itself
fails; operators can opt it into enforcement. A config that cannot be loaded
with no last-good copy follows that unrestricted default for this one tool while
all other calls fail closed.

This is a strong barrier against an agent *incidentally* surfacing a hidden
entity, not a cryptographic guarantee: enforcement scans for the hidden
entity_id, so a Jinja template or sandbox-adjacent computation that *derives* a
hidden entity's state without naming its entity_id cannot be caught. On enforced
scannable paths, a matching hidden entity's data is not returned. Existence
concealment is best-effort: per-tool not-found shapes vary, so a prober comparing
errors may infer that an id is hidden rather than absent. The boundary covers
Home Assistant entity data, not physical-world imagery: a visible camera stays
readable (`ha_get_camera_image`) and could incidentally show a display that
renders a hidden entity's state — hide that camera when its view is sensitive.
Enforce mode is not a defense against an adversarial prompt author deliberately
trying to exfiltrate a hidden entity's state, nor a substitute for Home
Assistant's permission model; restrict what the configured token can reach in
HA for a hard boundary.

### OAuth Bearer token design

In OAuth mode, access and refresh tokens are HMAC-signed, stateless Bearer
tokens. The token payload contains the user's Home Assistant long-lived access
token (LLAT). This is **by design**:

- The LLAT is the authorization boundary. Revoking it in Home Assistant
  immediately invalidates all derived tokens — that is the intended revocation
  path.
- Tokens are HMAC-signed (preventing forgery and tampering) but not encrypted.
  Encrypting the payload would not improve security: the LLAT must ultimately
  be sent to Home Assistant in cleartext over HTTPS to authenticate API calls.
  Anyone with access to the MCP server process can observe the LLAT regardless
  of token format.
- A party that captures a token can decode it to recover the LLAT. This is
  equivalent to capturing any other Bearer token that grants the same access —
  including the standard OAuth `client_credentials` model used by many MCP
  clients, where a static `client_secret` stored at the AI provider grants
  full service access. The trust boundary is identical; the only difference is
  packaging.
- Token revocation at the ha-mcp level is a no-op: there is no server-side
  token store. Revoke the LLAT in Home Assistant instead.

The consent form explains this revocation path. Reports about token opacity
(the LLAT being visible inside the token) will be closed as by-design.

### In-process server (`ha_mcp_tools` in-process server entry)

The `ha_mcp_tools` component's **in-process MCP server** config entry can run the
ha-mcp server in-process inside Home Assistant and expose it through a Home
Assistant webhook (see [docs/in-process-server.md](docs/in-process-server.md)).
It offers three authentication postures, selected by the **Authentication
mode** option in the entry options:

- **Secret webhook URL (default, `none`).** The webhook id is a high-entropy
  random string and *is* the credential — the same secret-URL trust model as
  standard mode above, except the URL is designed to be reached remotely through
  Home Assistant's own remote access (Nabu Casa or a TLS-terminating reverse
  proxy). Any party that has the full webhook URL is a trusted principal; keep
  the URL secret. **The secret URL is the main and only form of security in
  this mode.** The mode also serves an OAuth compatibility surface (discovery
  documents, an anonymous RFC 7591 registration endpoint, and an auto-approve
  authorization server) purely so OAuth-insisting connector brokers can
  complete a flow: the tokens it issues are cosmetic — bearers are ignored,
  the webhook URL remains the only credential. The auto-approve endpoint
  302-redirects to any spec-valid `redirect_uri` (https, or http loopback per
  RFC 8252; no fragment), which makes the Home Assistant origin usable as a
  crafted-link redirector — an accepted trade within this trust model
  (maintainer decision 2026-08-14, superseding the exact-match callback
  allowlist that shipped in #1976; the webhook-id protections from that PR are
  unchanged).
- **Home Assistant account (`ha_auth`).** Home Assistant Core is the OAuth
  authorization server: the entry serves the discovery documents and
  validates inbound Bearer tokens against Home Assistant's own auth, so access
  is gated by a Home Assistant login — and restricted to **administrator**
  users. The server acts with its own provisioned admin token (the caller's
  bearer is never forwarded), so accepting any valid login would grant every
  household member admin-equivalent control; non-admin, inactive, and
  system-generated users are rejected. This is distinct from the beta OAuth mode
  below — no bespoke authorization server or self-issued token is involved, and
  revoking the user's Home Assistant token/session revokes access.
  The component-scoped authorize/token/revoke endpoints front Core's own
  `/auth/*` (a browser redirect, a server-side token forward, and an RFC 7009
  revocation forward) so the URLs clients cache are the component's — Core
  remains the authorization authority and performs its own validation on every
  request. Revocation is fronted because the refresh token the client holds is
  a signed envelope naming the identity Core bound the grant to, and Core
  answers 200 for a token it does not recognise: posting the envelope to Core
  directly would report a revocation that never happened. The scoped endpoint
  is anonymous exactly as Core's own is (RFC 7009 authorizes the bearer of the
  token, not a client identity). It makes no outbound request for a token that
  is not one of its own envelopes; a prefixed one is forwarded even when its
  signature does not verify, which is what keeps revocation working after the
  signing key rotates (removing and re-adding the integration mints a new one).
  That grants a forger nothing: possession is the only authorization a
  revocation needs, and Core's revocation endpoint is anonymous and idempotent,
  so an unverified body could just as well have been posted to Core directly.
  The refresh path is the strict one — an envelope whose signature it cannot
  verify is answered locally and never forwarded. For URL-shaped client
  identities Core would reject (cross-origin Client ID Metadata Document
  clients), the component validates the CIMD document itself per the MCP
  2026-07-28 requirements (https-only fetch with no redirects, 10 KiB cap,
  exact `client_id` round-trip, `redirect_uris` match, loopback/IP-literal
  hosts refused) and forwards a same-origin-shaped client_id. This grants
  nothing new: Core already accepts any self-asserted redirect-origin
  client_id, so a validated translation authorizes only what a client could
  claim directly; anything failing validation is forwarded unchanged. The
  anonymous registration endpoint mints stateless public-client ids
  (HMAC-signed, embedding the registered redirect URIs — no server-side
  registration store); access still requires completing Core's admin login.
- **Legacy OAuth (`legacy`).** A self-hosted OAuth 2.1 authorization server the
  component serves on its scoped endpoints (`/api/ha_mcp_tools/oauth/authorize`
  + `/token`, which discovery advertises) and additionally at the Home
  Assistant root (`/authorize` + `/token`) as an alias for metadata-ignoring
  clients, for
  OAuth-only MCP clients that HA Core's native OAuth cannot serve (Google Gemini
  Spark's cross-origin Client-ID-Metadata-Document redirect, GitHub Copilot
  CLI's dynamic registration). The credential is a **static `client_id` +
  `client_secret`** the component generates (or the admin overrides), plus a
  signing key — all persisted in the config entry. Its security properties:
  - **The client secret is the boundary.** Anyone holding the `client_id` +
    `client_secret` can complete the flow and mint tokens; there is no
    per-user identity. Access is **admin-equivalent** — the same provisioned
    admin token backs it as the other modes. Keep the secret secret.
  - **Self-issued Bearer tokens**, HMAC-signed and stateless, carrying
    `{kind, iat, exp, jti, cid}` — **no** Home Assistant LLAT (unlike the beta
    OAuth mode in "OAuth Bearer token design" above; that section's
    LLAT-revocation model does **not** apply here). Access tokens live 1 hour,
    refresh tokens 30 days.
  - **Revocation is rotation + restart.** Regenerating the credential or
    changing the `client_id`/`client_secret` override rotates the signing key,
    which invalidates every outstanding token — but only once Home Assistant
    restarts, because the root `/authorize`/`/token` views cannot be rebound
    without a restart (a repair issue prompts for it). Until that restart the
    previous credential keeps working; the startup log withholds the rotated
    credential during that window so a still-valid old token cannot read it.
  - **The consent endpoint is unauthenticated** (no HA session) — it is a
    plain human-approval page. This is safe because the authorization code is
    inert without the `client_secret` at the token endpoint (the client is
    authenticated before any code is redeemed) and PKCE S256 binds the code to
    the caller.
  - **Redirect URIs are validated to a spec floor, not exact-matched:** any
    `https://` URL (or `http://` loopback per RFC 8252, for CLI clients on
    variable ports) with a valid host/port and no fragment is accepted. There
    is deliberately **no** per-client redirect allowlist — the mode exists
    precisely for clients whose redirect URIs cannot be pre-registered (Spark's
    is cross-origin; Copilot CLI's loopback port varies). A permissive
    redirect is not exploitable for token theft here (the code is inert without
    the secret), so this is an accepted deviation from RFC 9700's exact-match
    guidance, scoped to this single-tenant self-hosted AS.
  - **TLS is required in practice** — the endpoints ride Home Assistant's own
    HTTP, so expose them only over HA's HTTPS remote access (Nabu Casa or a
    TLS-terminating reverse proxy), never plaintext over the internet.
  - **Route ownership:** the component and the Webhook Proxy app both bind
    the root `/authorize`/`/token`; only one may own them per Home Assistant
    instance. When the app already owns them, the component's legacy mode
    still enables and serves on its scoped endpoints only, logging a warning —
    metadata-honoring clients are unaffected; metadata-ignoring clients that
    guess root paths reach the app instead.

Discovery never publishes the webhook id, in any of the three modes. The only
protected-resource document the entry serves is the path-scoped one at
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/webhook/<id>`, which a caller can
reach only by already holding the id, and the webhook's 401 challenge points
there rather than at a fixed, guessable path. Switching from `ha_auth` or
`legacy` back to the secret-URL posture therefore does not promote a published
value into the sole credential. Component versions before 2.1.1 also served the
document at a fixed path, where it handed the full webhook URL to any
unauthenticated GET while `ha_auth` or `legacy` was on; an install that ran
either mode reachable from the internet on such a version should use the
entry's **Regenerate connect secrets now** option once.

The connect notification deliberately carries no secrets: Home Assistant
shows persistent notifications to every authenticated user, so the webhook
URL (the credential in the default posture) is surfaced only on
administrator-only surfaces - the entry's Configure screen, the sidebar
panel, and the log. A local-only option removes the webhook entirely.

The server reaches Home Assistant with a dedicated admin token the component
provisions and stores in the config entry. The token is handed to the server
in-memory (never through the Home Assistant process environment); removing the
entry revokes it, and disabling the config entry stops the server. As with
standard mode, that token's Home Assistant permissions define what the server can
do.

The component also adds an admin-only **settings panel** to the Home Assistant
sidebar that reverse-proxies the server's web settings UI over Home Assistant's
own HTTP. Because a browser cannot attach a Bearer token to a panel view, access
is gated by a short-lived, HttpOnly session cookie that an authenticated
**administrator** obtains through Home Assistant, and every proxied request
re-validates that the session still maps to an active admin. The loopback secret
path is never exposed to the browser and no token or secret is placed in a URL;
the proxy returns 503 whenever the server is not running.

### Webhook Proxy app (`ha_mcp_webhook_proxy`)

In the app's `ha_auth` mode the Home Assistant login is the credential, not
the webhook URL. The URL without a Bearer gets a 401, and that 401 points at
the RFC 9728 protected-resource document served under the webhook's own path
(`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/webhook/<id>`) — the only
protected-resource document the app serves, and one a caller can reach only by
already holding the id. Discovery therefore never publishes the webhook id in
any mode, which is what lets the default posture with OAuth disabled keep
treating that URL as the sole credential.

**`ha_auth` is an access gate, not per-user authorization.** It validates the
inbound Bearer against Home Assistant core and accepts any token core still
honors, without inspecting the backing account: administrators,
non-administrators, and system-generated accounts are all accepted alike. (Home
Assistant core itself rejects a deactivated user's tokens, so deactivation does
revoke proxy access.) The in-process entry above, by contrast, accepts only
active human administrators. The caller's Bearer is never forwarded upstream:
the ha-mcp app services every request with its own
Supervisor/`homeassistant_api` privileges regardless of which account
authenticated. A caller holding a credential Home Assistant core honors is a
trusted principal per "MCP clients are trusted principals" above, which draws
the line at possession of a working credential — not at holding any particular
Home Assistant role.

Treat a Home Assistant account on this instance as admin-equivalent wherever the
app runs `ha_auth`: every account that can sign in reaches the same tool
surface. Because the gate never inspects the account's role, demoting a user out
of the administrator group does not revoke their access through the proxy —
deactivate the account, which Home Assistant honors immediately by dropping that
user's refresh tokens. Turning the app's OAuth mode off revokes nobody, and
loosens the boundary: the webhook id persists across the switch, so that posture
falls back to treating as the sole credential a URL every `ha_auth` client
already holds. Rotate the id (the app's DOCS.md, "Rotating the webhook URL")
when moving to the URL-secret posture. A fixed-path protected-resource document
also handed that URL to any anonymous GET the whole time `ha_auth` or `legacy`
was on, on app versions before 3.0.3.dev2 (dev channel) and before the stable
release that promotes it: an install that ran either mode reachable from the
internet on such a version should treat its webhook id as public and rotate
once, whichever posture it is moving to. From this version no anonymous URL publishes the id,
and a rotation takes effect immediately — the previous id's discovery URL
answers 404 as soon as the app restarts with the new id, and a Repair prompts
for the Home Assistant restart that binds the new id's discovery URL. The
in-process entry's admin restriction is a property of that entry, not a
guarantee of the app.

The app's `legacy` mode carries the same properties as the in-process
`legacy` mode described above — the component's implementation was ported from
this app's — including the static `client_id`/`client_secret` as the sole
boundary, admin-equivalent access, self-issued HMAC bearers, and revocation by
credential rotation plus a restart. Only one of the two may own the root
`/authorize` and `/token` routes per Home Assistant instance.

## Scope

**In scope** — please report these:

- Authentication bypass in standard (LLAT), OAuth, or OIDC mode
- OAuth mode: XSS, SSRF, open redirect, or credential exfiltration via the
  consent form or token endpoint (i.e. an unauthenticated party obtaining a
  token or extracting credentials without completing the consent flow)
- Unintended information disclosure via API responses (e.g. secrets returned to
  a client that shouldn't have them)
- Privilege escalation within the MCP tool surface
- Dependency vulnerabilities with a credible exploit path

**Out of scope** — these will not be actioned:

- Vulnerabilities in Home Assistant itself →
  report to [home-assistant/core](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security)
- Vulnerabilities in Nabu Casa or other remote access infrastructure
- Attacks requiring physical access to the HA host
- "The LLM performed a destructive action using valid, authorized tools" —
  this is a configuration or usage issue, not a security vulnerability.
  Tool visibility controls (`ENABLED_TOOL_MODULES`, group toggles) exist for
  this purpose.
- Prompt injection that only travels through read-only tool return values —
  the MCP client controls what the LLM sees and acts on; hardening that path
  is the client's responsibility (see [Threat Model](#threat-model) above).
- `python_transform` issues: the sandbox is not a security boundary between
  trusted and untrusted code. Problems with `python_transform` behavior are
  bugs, not security vulnerabilities.
- LAN-peer access to standard-mode HTTP endpoints: the local network is the
  trusted zone (see [Threat Model](#threat-model) above).
- DNS rebinding against the HTTP entrypoints: fastmcp's Host/Origin guard is off
  by default; URL-path secrecy is the boundary and the local network is the
  trusted zone (see [Threat Model](#threat-model) above).
- The web settings UI not being gated by the OAuth/OIDC token: fastmcp custom
  routes bypass the auth middleware by design, so a dedicated secret path gates
  it instead (see [OAuth Mode](#oauth-mode--beta-warning) below). Reports
  placing the settings routes at `<MCP_SECRET_PATH>/settings` in OAuth or OIDC
  mode describe pre-7.14.0 behavior.
- OAuth token containing an encoded LLAT: this is the Bearer token design
  (see [Threat Model](#threat-model) above).
- OAuth token revocation not preventing further HA API access: revoke the LLAT
  in Home Assistant instead.
- Saved custom tools (code mode, off by default) visible to other clients of the
  same server process: they are shared, persistent scaffolding — not per-user
  data — and `run_saved` executes with the caller's own HA token, granting no
  access the caller lacks. Any client that can reach ha-mcp is a trusted
  principal (see [Threat Model](#threat-model) above).
- Any Home Assistant account being accepted by the Webhook Proxy app's
  `ha_auth` mode — non-administrators and system-generated accounts alike:
  holding a credential Home Assistant core honors makes a caller a trusted
  principal (see [Threat Model](#threat-model) above), which is the bar that
  mode sets.
  `ha_auth` is an access gate, not per-user authorization; the in-process
  entry's admin restriction is a property of that entry, not a guarantee of the
  app.
- Vulnerabilities that are only exploitable due to a misconfigured deployment
  (e.g., standard-mode instance exposed to the internet without TLS, or a
  network-reachable HTTP entrypoint using the default `MCP_SECRET_PATH`).

## OAuth Mode — Beta Warning

The OAuth consent-flow mode (`ha-mcp-oauth` entrypoint) is **experimental**
and carries a larger attack surface than the standard LLAT setup.

- Not recommended for production without TLS and network access restrictions
- Requires explicit opt-in (`ha-mcp-oauth`); the default entrypoint is unaffected
- CVEs were published and fixed in v7.x (XSS: GHSA-pf93-j98v-25pv;
  SSRF: GHSA-fmfg-9g7c-3vq7). Upgrade to the latest release before deploying.
- The web settings UI is **not** gated by the OAuth token. It is served as
  fastmcp custom routes, which bypass `RequireAuthMiddleware`, so `mcp.auth`
  covers the MCP protocol endpoints only. Since 7.14.0 the UI is mounted under
  its own dedicated secret path — auto-generated as `/private_<token>` unless
  `MCP_SETTINGS_SECRET_PATH` is set, never advertised to MCP clients, and
  printed only in the startup log (GHSA-mx64-982r-65vg). That path is a
  credential: the surface behind it edits feature flags (including
  `read_only_mode`, `redact_secrets`, and the filesystem tools), tool
  configuration, the tool-security policy and entity visibility, and can
  restore or delete
  backups. Set `HA_MCP_DISABLE_SETTINGS_UI` to not serve the UI at all.
  Standard mode instead mounts the UI under the MCP secret path, which already
  gates the tool surface. The app mounts it twice: under that secret path
  for direct access, and at the bare root for Home Assistant ingress, where the
  routes admit only the Supervisor peer (`172.30.32.2`) and 403 every other
  caller.

If you choose to run OAuth mode, restrict the consent endpoint to trusted
networks and place it behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy.

### OIDC Mode

The OIDC entrypoint (`ha-mcp-oidc`) is also **new**. It proxies
authentication to your external identity provider via FastMCP's
`OAuthProxy` — unlike OAuth mode's self-contained authorization server —
and, like OAuth mode, exposes dynamic client registration (DCR) to any
client that can reach the discovery endpoints. The same TLS/reverse-proxy
recommendations apply, and
`OIDC_ALLOWED_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URIS` should be set for internet-facing
deployments (see [docs/oidc.md](docs/oidc.md)). The settings-UI caveat above
applies identically: `MCP_SETTINGS_SECRET_PATH`, not the OIDC token, is what
gates it.

Three further properties of the mode:

- **OIDC is an access gate, not per-user authorization.** Every authenticated
  user shares the one server-side `HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN`, so all requests act as
  the same Home Assistant identity. As in standard mode, there is no per-user
  isolation — reports assuming user A cannot reach user B's data do not apply.
  Per-user Home Assistant credentials exist only in OAuth mode.
- **The token audience is not checked by default.** With `OIDC_AUDIENCE` unset
  and `OIDC_VERIFY_ID_TOKEN` off, FastMCP's JWT verifier checks issuer,
  signature, and expiry but not `aud`. That is fine on an IdP dedicated to
  ha-mcp, and weaker on a shared one, where a token another client obtained
  from the same issuer would also pass. Set `OIDC_AUDIENCE` on a shared IdP.
- **Sessions persist across restarts, and revocation is rotation.** When
  `OIDC_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` is unset, the session signing key is derived
  deterministically from `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, so a restart does not log users
  out. To invalidate every outstanding session, rotate `OIDC_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`
  if it is set, and `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` otherwise.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the private reporting page at:
**https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/security/advisories/new**

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and to provide an initial
assessment shortly after. Remediation time depends on severity and complexity.
We practice coordinated disclosure and will agree a timeline with you,
typically within 90 days of the initial report. Severity is assessed using
CVSS base scores where applicable.

**Requirements for a valid report:**
- Reports must be made in good faith
- Demonstrate a real, reproducible issue with steps to reproduce
- Accurately reflect severity and impact — overstated reports are deprioritized
- Low-quality or AI-generated submissions without a working proof of concept
  will be closed without action
