# ha-mcp Code Review Guidelines

[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) is the canonical repository entry point and owns
agent behavior, permission, testing, scope, and workflow rules. This document
owns code-level conventions and review criteria that agents load when they are
changing or reviewing code. Keep a rule in one owner and link to it elsewhere;
if this file and `AGENTS.md` conflict, follow `AGENTS.md` and repair the
duplicate guidance in the same change.

## Project Context

**ha-mcp** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to control Home Assistant smart homes. It provides tools for entity control, automations, device management, and configuration via Home Assistant's REST and WebSocket APIs.

**Key Technologies:**
- Python 3.13, FastMCP framework
- Home Assistant REST API & WebSocket API
- MCP Protocol (Model Context Protocol)
- Architecture: Tool registry with lazy loading, service layer pattern, WebSocket state verification

**Code Organization:**
- `src/ha_mcp/tools/` - MCP tools (auto-discovered; current count: `site/src/data/tools.json`)
- `src/ha_mcp/client/` - REST and WebSocket clients
- `tests/src/e2e/` - End-to-end tests with real Home Assistant instance
- `tests/src/unit/` - Unit tests for utilities

## Test Coverage Requirements

The behavioral decision about when to write and run tests is canonical in
[`AGENTS.md` → Testing and verification](../AGENTS.md#testing-and-verification).
Reviewers use the severity guidance below to assess whether a change satisfies
that policy.

Flag missing coverage as HIGH severity when the root policy requires it. If the
change's scope or an allowed exception is unclear, flag test adequacy as MEDIUM
severity for manual verification.

**Test locations:**
- E2E tests (tool wiring and real Home Assistant behaviour): `tests/src/e2e/`
- Unit tests (logic): `tests/src/unit/`

Check new and changed tests against the
[test design rules](../tests/AGENTS.md#test-design-rules).

## Exception Handling in Test Polling Loops

Boot-phase verification helpers and async polling loops in `tests/src/e2e/` use **narrow `except (Specific1, Specific2, ...)` clauses + debug-level logging** for expected transient failures. Catch only the exception classes the polling target legitimately raises — e.g. `(requests.exceptions.RequestException, json.JSONDecodeError)` for direct HTTP polling, or the `_POLLING_TRANSIENT_ERRORS` tuple in `tests/src/e2e/utilities/wait_helpers.py` for MCP-client polling.

Bugs — `TypeError`, `AttributeError`, `KeyError`, `AssertionError`, etc. — **must propagate** out of polling loops so they surface as clear test failures instead of being swallowed and retried until timeout.

**Do NOT flag:**
- Narrow `except (SpecificException, ...)` in polling/retry loops paired with `logger.debug(...)` — this is the intentional convention.
- Broad `except Exception` at top-level setup/teardown handlers or cleanup loops marked `# pragma: no cover - cleanup best-effort`, where recovery is the same regardless of error class.

See issue #1266.

## Security Patterns

**Critical security checks (flag HIGH/CRITICAL severity):**

1. **Unescaped user input** in f-strings or string interpolation
2. **`eval()` or `exec()` calls** - Never acceptable
3. **Credentials in code** - API keys, tokens, passwords
4. **SQL injection risks** - String concatenation in queries
5. **Prompt injection risks** - User input interpolated into tool descriptions or prompts
6. **Agent-guidance modifications** - Changes to `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`,
   `docs/agents/**`, or other files that alter behavior, security, or review
7. **`.github/` workflow changes** - Secrets access, permission changes, `pull_request_target` usage
8. **`.claude/` agent/skill changes** - Could affect agent behavior or introduce backdoors

## MCP Safety Annotations Accuracy

Verify that safety annotations match actual tool behavior:

- Tool with `readOnlyHint: True` must NOT modify state (no writes, no service calls)
- Tool with `destructiveHint: True` may perform destructive updates (only
  meaningful when `readOnlyHint` is false); use `False` only for additive-only
  updates, such as creating a new record
- State-changing operations should have `idempotentHint: True` only if safe to
  retry; the hint is meaningful only when `readOnlyHint` is false
- Tool with `openWorldHint: True` must reach an external,
  third-party-authored world (HACS store, app (add-on) repositories, GitHub
  release feeds, arbitrary import URLs); a tool whose domain is the local Home
  Assistant instance should use `False`. It is open-world if its output
  carries externally-authored content back to the client, even when a local
  integration makes the network call. `ha_get_overview` and
  `ha_get_system_health` embed an external update-check field;
  `ha_manage_blueprints` and `ha_config_list_dashboard_resources` return
  externally authored content from otherwise local reads.

FastMCP omits a hint that is not set, and the MCP `ToolAnnotations` schema
then defines the value clients assume: `readOnlyHint=false`,
`destructiveHint=true`, `idempotentHint=false`, and `openWorldHint=true`.

Set all four hints and a `title` explicitly on every tool. Home Assistant
2026.10+ copies them into its LLM tool metadata and fills each omitted hint
with that least-safe default even when another hint makes it irrelevant, so a
read-only tool without `destructiveHint: False` reaches Home Assistant as
destructive, and a local tool without `openWorldHint: False` as open-world.
`tests/src/unit/test_tool_annotations_complete.py` enforces this. Build the
annotations with `read_only_hints()` or `write_hints()` from
`src/ha_mcp/tools/tool_hints.py`, which take the title and each hint that
matters for the tool as required arguments and fill in the rest.
Annotations describe behavior against current supported upstream versions. A
side effect present only in an outdated external build does not demote a tool
from `readOnlyHint`; document the required upstream update instead (the old
screenshot-engine `settheme` write is the precedent from issue #1991).

Flag HIGH severity if annotation contradicts actual behavior in the implementation.

## Tool Naming Convention

Use `ha_<verb>_<noun>`:

- `get`: one item, such as `ha_get_state`.
- `list`: a collection, such as `ha_list_services`.
- `search`: a filtered query, such as `ha_search`.
- `set`: create or update, such as `ha_config_set_helper`.
- `delete`: delete a dashboard, config entry, or file.
- `remove`: remove a registry item.
- `call`: execute an operation.
- `manage`: one interface intentionally combining multiple operations.

Grouped families may insert a namespace:
`ha_<namespace>_<verb>_<noun>`. Established namespaces include `ha_config_*`
and developer-mode-only `ha_dev_*`.
`ha_dev_*` tools register only when `enable_dev_mode` is enabled in the
Developer section of the web settings UI's Server Settings tab.

Accepted natural-name exceptions are:

- `ha_restart`, `ha_reload_core`, `ha_eval_template`
- `ha_report_issue`
- `ha_read_file`, `ha_write_file`, `ha_bulk_control`, `ha_search`

When no verb fits, update this list rather than forcing an inaccurate name.
This section is the single source of truth for tool naming.

Flag MEDIUM severity if a tool name violates the rules defined there.

## Tool File Organization

New tools belong in `src/ha_mcp/tools/tools_<domain>.py` with a
`register_<domain>_tools()` function. The registry auto-discovers it; do not
add manual central registration.

`@tool` from `ha_mcp._vendor.fastmcp.tools` must be the outermost decorator, above
`@log_tool_usage`, so the final method keeps `__fastmcp__`.
`register_tool_methods()` discovers decorated methods and adds them to the
server.

Numeric parameter bounds use `ge=`/`le=`, never `gt=`/`lt=`. From Home
Assistant 2026.9, Core re-emits every LLM-API tool schema through Probatio's
OpenAPI 3.0 codec, which writes an exclusive bound the Draft-4 way; the
Anthropic API validates `input_schema` as draft 2020-12 and rejects the whole
request, so one exclusive bound anywhere in the toolset fails every
conversation turn rather than only calls to the tool carrying it (#2361). Pick
an inclusive floor below any usable value.
`tests/src/unit/test_tool_schema_exclusive_bounds.py` enforces this over the
tools the registry registers. It does not reach a schema built outside the
registry — the search transform's synthesized meta-tools, for instance — so
those carry the rule without a net under them.

```python
from typing import Any

from ha_mcp._vendor.fastmcp.tools import tool

from .helpers import log_tool_usage, register_tool_methods
from .tool_hints import read_only_hints


class DomainTools:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self._client = client

    @tool(
        name="ha_<verb>_<noun>",
        tags={"Category Name"},
        annotations=read_only_hints("<Verb> <Noun>", open_world=False),
    )
    @log_tool_usage
    async def ha_<verb>_<noun>(self, param: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """<Action verb> <what the tool does in one sentence>."""
        ...


def register_<domain>_tools(mcp, client, **kwargs):
    register_tool_methods(mcp, DomainTools(client))
```

## Structured Error Responses

Tool-level failures raise `ToolError`, which sets MCP `isError=true`.
Batch-item failures inside a successful result array are the only exception.
Never return a plain error dictionary from a tool-level failure.

Use the helpers in `errors.py` and `helpers.py`; do not construct raw error
payloads. In exception blocks, `exception_to_structured_error()` raises by
default:

```python
from ha_mcp._vendor.fastmcp.exceptions import ToolError

from .helpers import exception_to_structured_error

try:
    ...
except ToolError:
    raise
except Exception as exc:
    exception_to_structured_error(
        exc,
        context={"entity_id": entity_id},
        suggestions=["Verify the entity exists"],
    )
```

The explicit `except ToolError: raise` guard is required when the `try`
body may call `raise_tool_error()` or a validation helper; otherwise a broad
handler remaps the intentional error to `INTERNAL_ERROR`.

For validation, call
`raise_tool_error(create_error_response(ErrorCode.VALIDATION_INVALID_PARAMETER, ...))`.
For service failures, check `result.get("success")` and raise
`ErrorCode.SERVICE_CALL_FAILED` with `result.get("error", "Operation failed")`
as the message. Batch items may append `create_error_response(...)` without
raising. Use `raise_error=False` only when the payload must be adjusted before
raising, and never add timezone metadata to errors.

`exception_to_structured_error()` classifies 404, authentication, and timeout
exceptions. Its `context` is functional: an `entity_id` can produce
`ENTITY_NOT_FOUND`, while `operation` and `timeout_seconds` describe a
`TimeoutError`. Available constructors are `create_error_response`,
`create_entity_not_found_error`, `create_connection_error`,
`create_auth_error`, `create_service_error`, `create_validation_error`,
`create_config_error`, and `create_timeout_error`.

Flag HIGH severity when a tool returns a plain error, swallows `ToolError`, or
bypasses the shared structured-error helpers.

Guidance that earns its keep in the suggestions:

- A rejection for a missing or misplaced field says where the field goes
  (e.g. a config root key passed as a top-level argument is told it belongs
  inside `config`).
- When one call breaks several independent input rules, the rejection reports
  all of them in one response instead of one round trip each.


## Code Conventions

### MCP Tool Docstrings

These rules apply to new or modified tool docstrings in the PR diff only -- not to pre-existing docstrings in unchanged files.

**Flag MEDIUM severity when a new or modified tool docstring:**
- Does not start with an action verb (`Returns...` should be `Get...`; valid verbs: `Get`, `List`, `Search`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Remove`, `Execute`, `Call`, `Manage`, or the tool's own verb when its name is an accepted natural-name exception, such as `Read` for `ha_read_file`)
- Is missing entirely or is still a placeholder
- References a non-existent tool (e.g., `ha_get_domain_docs` -- the correct name is `ha_get_skill_guide`)
- Embeds a full parameter schema instead of deferring to `ha_get_skill_guide`
- Is a workflow-entry tool but gives no hint about the next natural tool to call
- Multi-line docstring does not follow this structure: (1) what the tool does, (2) when NOT to use it with preferred alternatives, (3) when to use it, and (4) caveats.
- Restates a fact that one of the tool's `Field(description=...)` strings already carries, or the reverse.
- Contains a parameter section (`Args:`, `Parameters`, `:param x:`). FastMCP parses it, publishes only the text before the first section it recognises as the tool description, and drops the rest; `tests/src/unit/test_tool_docstring_no_parameter_section.py` enforces this.

Add a `RELATED TOOLS` hint when the tool starts a workflow and the natural
next call is not obvious, such as `ha_search` leading to `ha_get_state`.
Add `EXAMPLES` when a tool has multiple modes or non-obvious parameters;
omit them when one required parameter makes the call self-evident. The
structure follows
[Anthropic's tool-definition best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/define-tools#best-practices-for-tool-definitions),
which put a tool description at generally 3–4 sentences, more when the tool
is complex. A one-liner remains acceptable on a straightforward tool; do not
pad a simple tool's description to reach a sentence count.

State each fact once in the tool definition. What one parameter means, its
format, accepted values and effect belong in that parameter's
`Field(description=...)`, which is where Anthropic's examples place them; the
docstring carries what the tool does, when (not) to use it, how parameters
combine into modes, caveats and whole-call `EXAMPLES`. Both texts reach the
model in the same definition, so a copy in the other place adds tokens and
no information. Do not repeat types already present in the signature, Home
Assistant domain facts the model already knows, or motivational prose. State
consequences and permission prerequisites (admin token, developer mode) in
plain prose; the `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint` and `idempotentHint`
annotations carry side effects and retry safety, so do not restate those
with magic docstring keywords.

**Do NOT flag:**
- Concise one-liners on straightforward tools (progressive disclosure: brief by default)
- Missing examples on tools with obvious single-parameter calls
- Multi-line docstrings that stay focused and on-topic

Python type hints and async/await usage are canonical in [`AGENTS.md` → Code Conventions](../AGENTS.md#code-conventions); flag unannotated signatures and inconsistent async/await for I/O.

## Documentation Standards

1. **Comments**: The rule is canonical in [`AGENTS.md` → Code Conventions](../AGENTS.md#code-conventions). Flag comments that restate what the code already says.
2. **CHANGELOG.md**: The root file and its `homeassistant-addon/` copy are generated by semantic-release (see [`AGENTS.md` → Code Conventions](../AGENTS.md#code-conventions)); flag manual edits to them.
3. **Apps, not add-ons**: Follow the canonical terminology and identifier exceptions in [the development reference](../docs/agents/development.md#terminology-apps-not-add-ons). Flag MEDIUM severity when new user-facing text uses the retired product term by itself.

## Architecture Alignment

1. **New tools**: Create `tools_<domain>.py` with `register_<domain>_tools()` function
2. **Shared logic**: Use service layer (`smart_search/`, `device_control.py`)
3. **WebSocket operations**: Verify state changes in real-time
4. **Tool completion**: Operations should wait for completion (not just API acknowledgment)

## Tool Tags and Return Values

Every tool needs a native FastMCP `tags={"Category Name"}`. Tags feed the
generated README table, `site/src/data/tools.json`, and the Home Assistant app
documentation. `sync-tool-docs.yml` regenerates them after merge; use
`python scripts/extract_tools.py` only when local generated output is needed.

A tool returns a dict of its result fields. FastMCP sends a returned dict as
the MCP result's `structuredContent` exactly as returned, with its JSON
serialization as a text block for older clients, and the MCP specification
places no requirement on that object's keys beyond a declared `outputSchema`.
Success and failure are signalled at the protocol level instead: a failure
raises `ToolError`, which sets `isError: true`. The dict itself therefore
carries the result fields directly (`{"success": True, "entity_id": ...,
"state": ...}`); nest them under a key such as `data` only where the payload is
itself one record distinct from the response metadata, as `ha_config_set_helper`
does. Whatever shape a tool chooses, it returns that one shape on every branch,
so a caller never has to guess which key holds the result (issue #1293).

`warnings` is always a top-level `list[str]`, omitted when empty. It is
never nested in a payload key and never represented by a singular `warning`
string. Tool-level failure raises `ToolError`; only an item inside a batch
result may use `{"success": False, "error": {...}}`.
For a tool that builds its response on several branches, see
`config_helpers/schemas.py::HelperResponse` / `_helper_response` and
`tests/src/unit/test_helper_response_shape.py`.

## Tool Waiting Behavior

Tools wait for logical completion instead of returning on API acknowledgement
when a reliable completion signal exists. An optional `wait` parameter
defaults to `True`:

- Configuration operations poll until the entity is queryable or removed.
- State-changing service calls poll for the expected state transition.
- Fire-and-forget automation triggers and external async operations return
  immediately.
- Query tools return immediately and do not expose `wait`.

Use the shared helpers in `src/ha_mcp/tools/ws_waiters.py`:
`wait_for_entity_registered()`, `wait_for_entity_removed()`, and
`wait_for_state_change()`. For bulk work, callers may use `wait=False` and
then batch-verify.

## Tool Consolidation and Module Size

When another tool fully covers a tool's behavior, remove the redundant tool and
update references rather than adding a deprecation shim. Fewer, more distinct
tools improve model selection. Combine frequently chained operations when the
combined interface remains coherent.
This repository exceeds the
[10–20 tool range](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling)
where selection accuracy degrades, so reducing count is a priority. See also
[Anthropic's tool-design guidance](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents).

Consolidation, renaming with a migration path, parameter evolution, and return
restructuring are not breaking when the same outcome and information remain
available. Removing functionality with no replacement is breaking.

Module size is canonical in
[`AGENTS.md` → Code Conventions](../AGENTS.md#code-conventions). Flag a module
past about 1,000 lines that spans multiple concerns; the size alone is a
signal, not a mechanical limit.

## Context Engineering & Progressive Disclosure

This project follows [context engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) and [progressive disclosure](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/) principles:

**Review for:**

1. **Statelessness (HIGH severity if violated):**
   - Tools should NOT maintain server-side session state
   - Use content-derived identifiers (hashes, IDs) that clients pass back
   - Example: Dashboard updates use content hashing, not session tracking

2. **Validation delegation (MEDIUM severity):**
   - Let Home Assistant's backend handle validation when possible
   - Keep tool parameters simple - backend handles coercion, defaults, validation
   - Only add tool-side validation when it genuinely adds value

3. **Progressive disclosure (flag if violated):**
   - Tool descriptions should be concise, NOT embed full documentation
   - Hint at documentation tools for complex schemas
   - Error responses should guide next steps (include `suggestions` array)
   - Return essential data only - let users request details via follow-up tools

4. **When tool-side logic IS valuable:**
   - Format normalization for UX convenience (e.g., `"09:00"` → `"09:00:00"`)
   - Parsing JSON strings from MCP clients that stringify arrays
   - Combining multiple HA API calls into one logical operation

## Breaking Changes

A change is BREAKING only if it removes functionality that users depend on.

**Breaking Changes (flag CRITICAL):**
- Deleting a tool without providing alternative functionality elsewhere
- Removing a feature that has no replacement in any other tool
- Making something impossible that was previously possible

**NOT Breaking (these are improvements - encourage them):**
- Tool consolidation (combining multiple tools into one)
- Tool refactoring (restructuring how tools work internally)
- Parameter changes (as long as same outcome achievable)
- Return value restructuring (as long as data still accessible)
- Tool renaming with clear migration path

**Rationale:** Tool consolidation reduces token usage and cognitive load for AI agents. Refactoring improves maintainability. Only flag CRITICAL when functionality is genuinely lost forever.

## Accessibility (web UI)

Both rendered surfaces — the Astro docs site (`site/`) and the app settings UI (`src/ha_mcp/settings_ui/__init__.py` + `settings.css` / `settings_js/`) — follow the conventions from #1574/#1596, anchored in CI by the `site-checks` job (`astro check`, `eslint-plugin-astro` + `jsx-a11y`, and an axe-core audit over the built pages — all blocking).

**Flag MEDIUM severity when a change:**

- Adds a blanket `aria-label` to an element that already has visible text. Accessible names come from native semantics first — real `<button>` / `<a>` / `<label>` / `<h*>` with visible text, or `<fieldset>` + `<legend class="visually-hidden">` for grouped controls. Reach for `aria-label` only when there is no visible text (e.g. an icon-only button).
- Drops or omits a landmark: each page needs one `<main>` (the skip-link target) and `<nav>` for navigation (a second nav on the same page needs a distinguishing `aria-label`); page content should sit inside a landmark.
- Removes the skip-to-content link or its `#main-content` target.
- Builds a tab UI out of bare `<button>`s. A real tab strip uses `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` / `role="tabpanel"` with `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, roving `tabindex`, and Arrow/Home/End keyboard support (see the settings UI tablist).
- Updates a status/feedback region without announcing it: status spans carry `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`, switching to `role="alert"` / `aria-live="assertive"` on the failure path.
- Skips a heading level (e.g. `<h2>` straight to `<h4>`). Keep levels ordered; use Tailwind size classes for visual size, not the tag level.

**Theme / contrast tier model (#1574):** theme (`data-theme` auto/light/dark), contrast (`data-contrast` normal/high) and shade (`data-shade`) are set on `<html>` pre-paint and mirrored between the docs site and settings UI (parity enforced by `tests/src/unit/test_anti_fouc_parity.py`). Keep new preferences in this tier model, apply them on both surfaces, and preserve the 4.5:1 custom-color contrast warning.

## Addressing CodeRabbit Reviews

Ensure ALL CodeRabbit review comments are addressed, both inline threads and
top-level review bodies. CodeRabbit nests some findings — *Outside diff range
comments* and *Nitpick comments* — inside collapsed sections of the review
body rather than as inline threads, so they create no unresolved-thread
signal and a green check while unaddressed. Everything must be addressed:
read each review body in full and assess those findings exactly like inline
comments. See the [GitHub workflow reference](../docs/agents/github-workflow.md#review-comments) for the full-body sweep.

## Non-Blocking Suggestions and Scope

Scope is defined by the user (the maintainer / author of the PR), not by the reviewer (bot or human). **Never unilaterally file a follow-up issue or PR** — raise scope concerns in the PR review and let the user decide whether to address inline, defer, or dismiss. Do not skip legitimate findings — surface them.

If you believe a finding is likely out of scope, say so explicitly so the user can verify: *"This may be out of scope — user should verify. I think it is out of scope because [specific reason]."* Do not bucket findings as "for a future PR" or "post-merge follow-up."

Do not phrase findings as "post-merge follow-up," "nice to have," or "happy to file an issue" when the change is small and bundleable. Either apply the suggestion inline with a code suggestion block, or raise it plainly and let the user decide.

See AGENTS.md § *Boy Scout Rule — Handling Discovered Improvements* for the author/agent-side rule.

## Native Core contracts

Read and write wrappers follow the [native Core contract guidance](../docs/agents/native-core-contracts.md). Keep domain validation in Core; distinguish wrapper safeguards and incomplete schema descriptions from native validation.
