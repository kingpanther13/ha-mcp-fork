"""Parse a CodeQL SARIF file, report findings, and gate on them.

CodeQL's Code Quality preview (the GitHub Settings → Security → Code quality
page) is only available to Team/Enterprise Cloud org plans, so it cannot be
enabled on this repo's free org. This script provides an equivalent gate by
running the ``<language>-code-quality.qls`` suite via the CodeQL CLI in CI
and failing the job when any finding remains. The workflow also feeds the
default ``<language>-code-scanning.qls`` security suite through the same
gate, because GitHub default setup only analyzes master post-merge and does
not block PRs (see the header of codeql-quality.yml).

Usage:
    codeql_quality_gate.py <quality.sarif>

Exits 1 if the SARIF contains any results, 0 otherwise. A grouped, sorted
finding list is printed to stdout and (when running in Actions) appended to
the job summary.
