        HA's WebSocket API identifies a subscription by the ``id`` of the
        original ``subscribe_events`` command — not by a field inside the
        ``result`` payload. ``handle_subscribe_events`` in HA Core
        (``websocket_api/commands.py``) ends with
        ``connection.send_result(msg["id"])``, and ``send_result(msg_id)``
        emits ``{"id": N, "type": "result", "success": true, "result": null}``.
        Subsequent event deliveries arrive as
        ``{"id": N, "type": "event", "event": {...}}`` with the same ``id``.

        The previous implementation called ``send_command`` (which discards
        the message_id it generated) and then looked for
        ``response["result"]["subscription"]``, a field HA does not send.
        That branch never matched, so this function always raised
        ``"Failed to get subscription ID"`` — even though the underlying
        subscription on HA's side WAS established. The ``WebSocketListenerService``
        treated the raised exception as a startup failure and left
        ``_listener_started = False``, so every device-control call
        repeatedly retried (and re-failed) and ``OperationManager.process_state_change``
        was never invoked, leaving every async operation in PENDING until
        ``OperationManager.get_operation`` flipped it to TIMEOUT after
        the 10s ``timeout_ms`` budget. Surfaced during PR #1375 HAOS log
        audit (3x "Failed to get subscription ID" per bulk-control test).

        cancellation, and awaited through a shield with a deadline, which
        makes it finish before control returns to anyone. The same shape as
        the theme-guard session cleanup, for the same reason.
