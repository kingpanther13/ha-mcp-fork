    # the report type choice, the missing-tool pre-check, and the mandatory
    # anonymisation step. Issue reporting is ha-mcp product meta — it
    # cannot go in the skill pack, whose CONTRIBUTING forbids coupling
    # skill content to specific MCP tool names. The lite text says so
    # outright so a compliant agent doesn't spend a call finding out.

# Where each _LITE_DOCSTRINGS entry's "see ..." pointer actually lands.
#
# The pointer is the whole bargain of lite mode: the trimmed text is only
# acceptable because the detail is reachable. Enforcing that every entry
# merely CONTAINS the string "ha_get_skill_guide" (the original
# invariant) checks the pointer and never the destination — which is how
# an entry deferring to guide content that does not exist could pass
# tests (#2153 review). This map names the destination so
# tests/src/unit/test_lite_docstrings.py can resolve it against the
# vendored skill pack.
#
# Three legal value forms, each with a matching check in the tests:
#
#   "references/<file>.md" / "SKILL.md"
#       A path inside the home-assistant-best-practices skill. Must
#       resolve against the VENDORED pack, and the lite text must carry
#       a ha_get_skill_guide pointer to reach it.
#   "tool-response:<field>"
#       The guidance ships in the tool's own response instead. The field
#       must actually be returned, and the lite text must name it.
#   "self-contained"
#       The entry defers nothing. The lite text must carry NO
#       ha_get_skill_guide pointer and name no reference file, so an
#       entry cannot quietly re-acquire a pointer to content that isn't
#       vendored — which is what "self-contained" exists to prevent.
