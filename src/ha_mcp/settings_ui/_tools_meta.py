Builds the per-tool metadata rows the settings page renders (real tools
via FastMCP's ``local_provider`` plus injected stubs for
transform-generated / feature-gated tools) and applies the persisted
enabled/disabled/pinned state onto the live FastMCP instance
(``apply_tool_visibility``). The capability badge tier comes from the
same ``categorize_capability`` classifier that routes the
read/write/delete proxies, so the badge and the routing never disagree.
