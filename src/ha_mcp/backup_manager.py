"""Auto-backup of HA config domains before write/destructive operations.

Closes #1288. Captures per-entity pre-write state to a local directory.
Best-effort: failures log a WARNING but never block the underlying write.

Storage path resolution
-----------------------
``Settings.auto_backup_dir`` overrides; otherwise defaults to
``/data/ha_mcp_backups`` in the add-on (SUPERVISOR_TOKEN set + ``/data``
exists), else ``<data dir>/backups`` where the data dir is what
``utils.data_paths.get_data_dir`` resolves (``HA_MCP_CONFIG_DIR``,
``~/.ha-mcp``, or the tmpdir fallback). Installs that still hold snapshots
under the pre-#2372 default ``${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/ha_mcp/backups``
keep using that directory; see ``_resolve_default_dir``.

File format
-----------
One YAML file per snapshot, named
``<domain>.<safe_entity_id>.<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.yaml``::

    # ha_mcp_backup
    schema_version: 1
    domain: automation
    entity_id: kitchen_lights
    captured: 2026-05-21T15:30:00+00:00
    tool: ha_config_set_automation
    config:
      alias: Kitchen lights
      trigger: ...

Domain handlers
---------------
``DomainHandler`` pairs a backup-domain string with two coroutines:

- ``fetch(client, entity_id) -> config dict``  — read pre-write state
- ``restore(client, entity_id, config) -> result`` — re-apply the saved state

One handler per backed-up domain. Helper types each register their own
handler keyed ``helper_<type>`` since each helper type has a distinct
WS endpoint shape.

        and swallowed so the wrapped write can proceed regardless.

        ``mandatory=True`` makes the snapshot a precondition (file/YAML writes,

        (``config is None``) or a no-id create call, and a throttle skip (a

        The ``handler is None`` and ``config is None`` skips still
        apply (force can't conjure a snapshot for an entity that
        doesn't exist or has no registered handler).
