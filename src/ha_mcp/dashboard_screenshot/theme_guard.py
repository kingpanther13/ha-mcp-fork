"""Detect when the screenshot engine changes the engine user's saved theme.

Puppet dispatches Home Assistant's ``settheme`` event on cold-browser
renders. Its ``dark`` query flag is presence-based, so "not requested"
reaches the frontend as an explicit "light". Home Assistant persists that
selection server-side per user (``frontend/set_user_data``, key ``"theme"``)
and syncs it to every session of the user whose long-lived token the engine
runs with, so a screenshot flips that user's real web and mobile UI (#1909).

Upstream stopped the dispatch for renders requesting nothing
(balloob/home-assistant-addons#89), but by its own title only for that case,
and it is unreleased as of Puppet 2.6.0 -- so on current releases every
render writes.

**This guard never writes.** It reads the saved theme before the batch and
again afterwards, and when the render changed it, reports the previous value
so the agent can restore it with ``ha_manage_theme`` -- a tool correctly
annotated as a write. That keeps the screenshot and dashboard-get tools
honestly ``readOnlyHint: True`` (#1991, PR #2014) while still surfacing the
damage. Because nothing is written, concurrent batches cannot corrupt each
other and no serialization is needed.

Pointing the engine at its own dedicated Home Assistant user avoids the
problem outright: the write then lands on an account nobody looks at.

Credential resolution mirrors engine discovery:

- **HA OS / Supervised** -- the Puppet add-on's own ``access_token`` and
  ``home_assistant_url`` options, taken from the Supervisor add-on info that
  engine discovery already fetches. The token lives only in process memory
  and is never logged or returned.
- **Docker / standalone / OAuth / embedded** -- ha-mcp's direct Home
  Assistant credentials, which match whenever the engine runs with a token
  for the same user (the common single-user setup).
- Anything else -- detection stays inactive and captures behave as before.
