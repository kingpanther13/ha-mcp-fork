        """Search for entities (lights, sensors, switches, climate, etc.) by name, domain, or area — AND inside automation/script/scene/helper/dashboard configurations — in one call.

        Two surfaces run in parallel and return tagged results:
          - **entities**: entity-registry matches (entity_id, friendly name,
            area). Filter with `domain_filter`/`area_filter`/`state_filter`;
            omit `query` to enumerate a domain, area, or state.
          - **automations / scripts / scenes / helpers / dashboards**: matches
            *inside* config definitions — triggers, actions, sequences, scene
            entity-sets, helper bodies, dashboard cards. Driven by `query`;
            narrow with `search_types`.

        Use dedicated get/list tools first for a known resource type, including
        ha_config_get_scene for scene listing and content search. Use this for
        broader discovery or deep searches across resource types.

        For control requests with exclusions such as "except", "excluding", or
        "but not", include `is_group` and `member_entity_ids` in `result_fields`.
        Do not control an aggregate whose members include an excluded entity;
        prefer leaf entities when the exception cannot be verified safely.
        A withheld member list still returns is_group=true; absence of
        member_entity_ids must not be interpreted as a leaf entity.

        When NOT to use:
          - To read a known entity_id's state: use `ha_get_state` (cheaper).
          - To inspect one automation/script/scene config by id: use the
            matching `ha_config_get_*`.
          - To list installed Apps (add-ons): use `ha_get_app`.

        Config-body search is skipped when `domain_filter`/`area_filter`/
        `state_filter` signal entity-only intent (keeping name lookups off the
        expensive backend); a `warnings[]` entry names the skip. Repeat without
        entity filters to search configuration contents too. Explicit legacy
        `search_types=[...]` calls search configs only and skip entities.

        Caveats:
          - `partial: True` means results are NOT exhaustive — a surface raised,
            or the config-body branch lost data (per-id time budget exhausted,
            an individual fetch failed, or a helper-type list fetch failed).
            Empty buckets with `partial: True` mean "search failed", not "no
            results". The cause is in `partial_reason`, also mirrored into
            `warnings[]` with an "incomplete results: " prefix. Do not treat a
            partial response as complete.
          - `count` is items in this response (post-pagination), not corpus
            totals — use `entity_total_matches` + `config_total_matches`.
          - `limit`/`offset` apply per-surface. Flat `has_more`/`next_offset`
            page the next call (iterate `offset = next_offset`); per-surface
            `entity_*`/`config_*` variants show which surface still has results.

        For parameters, schema, and worked examples, see ha_get_skill_guide.

        Examples:
            - List sensors in an area: ha_search(domain_filter="sensor", area_filter="Living Room")
            - Find a light by name: ha_search("kitchen", domain_filter="light")
            - Find lights safely before an "all except one" control request:
              ha_search("living room", domain_filter="light",
              result_fields=["entity_id", "friendly_name", "is_group",
              "member_entity_ids"])
            - Which automations use an entity: ha_search("light.bed_light")
            - Scenes touching a light: ha_config_get_scene(query="light.kitchen", search_in_config=True)
            - Narrow the response to the entity bucket: ha_search("kitchen", fields=["entities"])
            - All unavailable entities: ha_search(state_filter="unavailable")

        - filter inactive → ``(True, None)``: the plain component search, no
          ``visibility`` param (parity with a pre-``search_visibility`` component).
        - filter active + ``search_visibility`` + config serialized:
          - component also advertises ``search_visibility_allowlist_authorization``
            → ``(True, <wire dict + allowlist_authorization: True>)``. The key opts
            the component into the revised rule (an allow match authorizes past
            category, HA-hidden, and Assist filters). It is never sent to a
            component lacking the capability: that component's strict schema would
            reject it, and the key's absence is what keeps a newer component on the
            legacy precedence the released server still applies in its own
            outbound scan.
          - no allowlist dimensions → ``(True, <wire dict>)``: the nine-key wire;
            with no allow dimensions the two precedences agree.
          - allowlist active without the capability → ``(False, None)``.
        - config could not be loaded → ``(False, None)``: the legacy path applies
          the filter server-side before the counts/pagination (fail-closed to
          legacy, matching ``visibility_state_and_wire``'s fail-closed pairing).

        ``visibility_state_and_wire`` loads the config once for both the active
        gate and its wire form, instead of the active check and the wire fetch
        each hitting the (memoized) config read separately.

        + label ids + device_id, and the area/floor/label registry lists resolve

        request skips the four ``*_registry/list`` reads, and a caller that already
        holds the registry entries (the area-mode haystack fetch) passes them as
        ``prefetched_entries`` so no second ``get_entries`` round-trip is made.
        Each fetch is fault-tolerant (``return_exceptions=True`` + the ``_ws_*``
        guards degrade a failed list to an empty index), so a registry hiccup drops
        that field to empty rather than failing the search — but a failed read is no

        """Get AI-friendly system overview with intelligent categorization.

        Returns comprehensive system information at the requested detail level,
        including Home Assistant base_url, version, location, timezone, entity overview,
        and active persistent notifications (if any).
        Use 'minimal' (default) for most queries. Domain counts and states_summary
        are always complete regardless of entity pagination.
        Standard/full modes paginate entities (default 200 per page) — use offset
        to fetch more. Use 'domains' filter to narrow scope.

        Use fields= to project the response to only the keys you need — a
        significantly smaller payload when fetching a single sub-section (e.g.
        fields=["system_info"] returns just that section instead of the full overview).
        Requests composed only of system_info, notification, repair, or server
        metadata fields also skip the unrelated state, service, and registry reads.

        Do not use this tool to inspect a known entity or a narrow set of entities.
        Use ha_get_state for one entity, ha_get_entity for registry metadata, or
        ha_search with a domain or area filter. An unprojected overview collects
        system-wide state, service, and registry data and can be expensive on large
        Home Assistant installations.

        When (and only when) the ha-mcp settings-UI sidecar is running
        (stdio mode, e.g. Claude Desktop / Claude Code), the response
        includes a ``settings_url`` field — the local URL to the
        tool-configuration page. Hand this URL to the user when they
        ask how to enable or disable tools or change server settings.
        ``settings_url`` is emitted regardless of ``fields=``
        projection (so it stays discoverable even when callers
        minimize the response) but only when the sidecar URL file
        actually exists.

        In standalone HTTP / Docker modes, when an HTTP settings prefix is
        advertised, there is no sidecar URL file and the server can't know its
        externally reachable host. The response instead carries a
        ``settings_url_hint`` string telling the user where the page is mounted
        and how to find or construct the full URL.
        Hand whichever of the two fields is present to the user.

        The response also carries an ``ha_mcp_update`` object
        ``{current, latest, update_available}`` reporting whether a newer ha-mcp
        release is available (PyPI for pip/Docker, the Supervisor add-on store
        for the add-on) — proactively tell the user when ``update_available`` is
        true. Emitted regardless of ``fields=``; omitted only for the
        ``unknown`` version and when ``HA_MCP_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`` is set.

        SINGLE ENTITY:
        Pass a string entity_id. Returns the entity's full state and attributes.

        MULTIPLE ENTITIES:
        Pass a list of entity IDs (max 100). Efficiently retrieves states using
        parallel requests. Duplicates are automatically deduplicated.
        Returns success=True if at least one entity state was retrieved.
        Check 'error_count' for any failed lookups in partial-success scenarios.

        FIELDS PROJECTION:
        `fields=` projects the per-entity record keys (see the fields= parameter
        description for the full key list), NOT the outer bulk response wrapper.
        In single-entity mode it filters keys of the returned record directly. In bulk
        mode it filters keys of each record inside `states[entity_id]`; outer keys
        (`success`, `count`, `states`, `errors`, ...) are always preserved.
        `attribute_keys=` further narrows the `attributes` sub-dict and is only applied
        when `"attributes"` is in `fields=` (or `fields=None`); otherwise it is a no-op.

        When `attribute_keys=` is set but has no effect (because `attributes` was
        excluded by `fields=`), a `warnings` list is emitted outside the projected
        entity record(s): in bulk mode at the response wrapper level (sibling of
        `success`/`count`/`states`); in single-entity mode at the top-level result
        (sibling of `data`/`metadata`, since the projected record IS `data`).
        The warnings list is never a record key, so `fields=["state"]` returns a
        record with only `state` regardless of whether the no-effect warning fires.

        EXAMPLES:
        - Single: ha_get_state("light.kitchen")
        - Multiple: ha_get_state(["light.kitchen", "light.living_room", "sensor.temperature"])
        - State only: ha_get_state("light.kitchen", fields=["state"])
