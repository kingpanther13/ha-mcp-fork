    """Read a config entry's ``options`` and report whether the probe succeeded.

    Starts the entry's OptionsFlow, harvests ``{name: current_value}`` from
    its first-step form via :func:`options_from_form_flow` (the persisted
    option from ``description.suggested_value``, falling back to the schema
    ``default``), and aborts the flow so it doesn't sit half-open. Returns
    ``(options, ok)`` so callers can tell a probe *failure* apart from a
    genuinely-empty options form — both yield ``{}`` for ``options``, but
    ``ok`` is:

    - ``True`` only when a form first-step was read (even if it harvested no
      fields: a genuinely-empty options form is a successful read).
    - ``False`` when the OptionsFlow could not be read into options: the flow
      raised, or its first step was not a form (a menu / abort / create_entry),
      so no options could be harvested.

    The flag lets callers surface degraded reads instead of passing ``{}``
    off as real options: ``smart_search`` flips ``partial`` when a probe
    fails mid-search, and ``ha_get_integration`` attaches a ``warnings``
    entry on its single-entry and list responses. The abort in ``finally``
    is cleanup; a failed abort does not flip ``ok`` (the options were
    already harvested).

    Home Assistant does not expose ``ConfigEntry.options`` through any
    read-only REST or WebSocket endpoint — ``/api/config/config_entries/entry``
    deliberately omits the field. The closest approximation that the HA UI
    itself uses is the OptionsFlow's first-step ``data_schema``: HA injects
    the persisted options into each field's ``description.suggested_value``
    (via ``add_suggested_values_to_schema``), which
    :func:`options_from_form_flow` prefers over the static schema
    ``default`` (issue #1575).

    Probe failures log at ``warning`` (so breakage of a deliberate
    single-entry probe is discoverable) unless ``quiet=True``, which demotes
    them to ``debug`` for bulk fan-out callers (e.g. ``smart_search`` probes
    one entry per flow-helper on every ``ha_search``; a per-entry
    warning there would spam the log on routine searches).

    Exposed at module level (not as a method) so non-class callers such as
    ``smart_search._search_flow_helpers`` can probe flow-helper config
    without instantiating ``IntegrationTools``.

    Returns the component's ``entries`` list — each row in the
    ``config_entries/get`` shape (identity + status fields plus the entry's
    already-materialized ``options`` [raw persisted, secret-scrubbed] and its
    ``subentries`` identity rows) — so a single in-process frame replaces the
    legacy REST list-all + OptionsFlow start/abort probe + subentries WS call.
    Pass ``entry_id`` for the single entry (empty list ⇒ no such entry) or
    ``domain`` to filter the list; neither lists all.

    Consumers: ``ha_get_integration`` (single-entry + list) and radio's
    ``resolve_entry_id`` (single-instance domain → entry_id) both import this so
    the domain/entry-scoped read routes through one place.

    ``None`` on capability miss, downgrade (``unknown_command`` → invalidate the
    cached caps), or command error/timeout (logged) — the caller falls back to
    its legacy path.

    Per the uniform transport-fallback taxonomy, a connection-establishment
    failure IS caught here and mapped to ``None`` (legacy fallback), like every
    component fetch helper. The callers' legacy paths are NOT the shared pooled WS —
    ``ha_get_integration`` reads pure REST (``get_config_entry`` /
    ``GET /config/config_entries`` + the REST OptionsFlow probe) and radio's
    ``resolve_entry_id`` uses the REST client's ``send_websocket_message``
    bridge — so a WS outage must not kill the tool when the legacy path can
    still serve the entry. (The bridge itself raises on a dead transport since
    #1947, which only matters for the radio caller: when the socket is dead
    that path has nothing to serve either, while the pure-REST caller is
    unaffected.) The catch stays broad so no unexpected fault escapes and
    kills the tool; routing any
    non-command component failure back to the legacy fetch is safe here (mirrors
    ``get_component_caps``' own broad-catch precedent). Otherwise the same caps-gate

        - Search: ha_get_integration(query="zigbee")

        - Get entry with diagnostics dump: ha_get_integration(entry_id="abc123", include_diagnostics=True)
        - Get device-scoped diagnostics: ha_get_integration(entry_id="abc123", include_diagnostics=True, device_id="dev123")
        - Get the parsed KNX ETS project (group-address table): ha_get_integration(entry_id="<knx entry>", include_knx_project=True)
        - Walk a sub-tree: ha_get_integration(entry_id="abc123", include_diagnostics=True, diagnostics_data_path="<dotted-path>")

        - List config subentries: ha_get_integration(entry_id="abc123", include_subentries=True)
        - Inspect subentry create schema: ha_get_integration(entry_id="abc123", include_subentry_schema=True, subentry_type="conversation")
        - Inspect subentry reconfigure schema: ha_get_integration(entry_id="abc123", include_subentry_schema=True, subentry_type="conversation", subentry_id="sub123")
        - List template entries: ha_get_integration(domain="template")

        STATES: 'loaded', 'setup_error', 'setup_retry', 'not_loaded',
        'failed_unload', 'migration_error'.

        OPTIONS: ``options`` reflect the entry's persisted values; a field that
        was never set may be absent (rather than shown at its schema default).
        Values that match a ``secrets.yaml`` entry are returned as
        ``"**redacted**"``. Use ``include_schema=True`` to see every editable
        field and its default/type. Nested option *sections* (e.g. a template
        helper's ``advanced_options``) are additively flattened one level —
        each section's leaf keys are copied to the top of ``options`` (mirroring
        the OptionsFlow-derived read) while the raw nested section is preserved
        for fidelity, and an existing top-level key is never overwritten.

        Each entry carries:

        - ``log_level``: the canonical Python logger level name
          (``DEBUG``/``INFO``/``WARNING``/``ERROR``/``CRITICAL``) when the
          integration has a ``logger.set_level`` override, or ``"DEFAULT"``
          (uppercase sentinel) when no override is set.
        - ``log_level_raw``: the original numeric level (e.g. ``10`` for DEBUG)
          when HA returned an int, ``None`` otherwise (no override set, or HA
          provided a level name as a string).

        This is distinct from the add-on side, where ``ha_get_addon`` returns
        Supervisor's lowercase ``"default"`` literal — do not cross-compare.

        """Remove a Home Assistant helper or integration config entry.

        Unifies three backend removal mechanisms — simple-helper websocket
        delete, config-entry delete, and config-subentry delete — behind one
        entry point with four routing paths driven by helper_type.

        WHEN NOT TO USE:
        - Removing only an entity (without deleting its underlying helper or
          config entry) — use `ha_remove_entity` instead.
        - YAML-configured helpers — they have no storage backend. Edit the
          YAML file and reload the relevant integration.

        SUPPORTED HELPER TYPES:
        - SIMPLE (12, websocket-delete): input_button, input_boolean,
          input_select, input_number, input_text, input_datetime, counter,
          timer, schedule, zone, person, tag.
        - FLOW (15, config-entry-delete via entity lookup): template, group,
          utility_meter, derivative, min_max, threshold, integration,
          statistics, trend, random, filter, tod, generic_thermostat,
          switch_as_x, generic_hygrostat.

        ROUTING:
        - SIMPLE helper_type + bare helper_id or entity_id → websocket delete.
        - FLOW helper_type + entity_id → resolve entity_id to config_entry_id
          via entity_registry, then delete the config entry. All sub-entities
          (e.g. utility_meter tariffs) are removed together.
        - helper_type=None + entry_id → direct config entry delete (any
          integration).
        - helper_type="config_subentry" + parent entry_id + subentry_id →
          delete one config subentry.

        MISSING-TARGET CONTRACT:
        A target that is *confirmed absent* raises a structured error
        rather than returning silent success, so a typo'd or stale
        identifier surfaces immediately at the caller layer (the
        ``success`` boolean is what agent wrappers branch on). The
        error code per-path follows the target shape:
        - SIMPLE (bare helper_id or entity_id): state-machine empty AND
          entity registry empty → raises ``ENTITY_NOT_FOUND``.
        - FLOW (entity_id): not in entity registry → raises
          ``ENTITY_NOT_FOUND``. YAML-configured helpers (no config entry
          backing) raise ``RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND``. A bare helper_id (no
          ``.``) on a FLOW target raises ``ENTITY_NOT_FOUND`` — FLOW
          resolution needs a full entity_id. TOCTOU 404 on the
          resolved entry_id raises ``RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND``.
        - Direct config entry (helper_type=None): backend returns HTTP
          404 → raises ``RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND``.
        - Config subentry: backend returns a "not_found" error → raises
          ``RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND``.

        Idempotency at the contract level still holds (call N times =
        same response). Transient connectivity failures (WebSocket
        disconnected, network timeouts) raise their own codes
        (``WEBSOCKET_DISCONNECTED``, ``CONNECTION_FAILED``) so retry
        logic can branch separately.

        EXAMPLES:
        - Remove SIMPLE button:
          ha_remove_helpers_integrations(
              target="my_button", helper_type="input_button", confirm=True
          )
        - Remove FLOW utility_meter (any sub-entity works):
          ha_remove_helpers_integrations(
              target="sensor.energy_peak",
              helper_type="utility_meter",
              confirm=True,
          )
        - Remove any integration by entry_id:
          ha_remove_helpers_integrations(
              target="01HXYZ...", confirm=True
          )

              subentry_id="subentry-123", confirm=True
          )

        **WARNING:** Removing a helper or integration that is referenced by
        automations, scripts, or other integrations may cause those to fail.
        Use ha_search() / ha_get_integration() to verify before
        removal. Cannot be undone.
