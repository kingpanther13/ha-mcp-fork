        Create or update a Home Assistant scene.

        MUST call ha_get_skill_guide OR refer to your locally installed skills first.

        Supports two modes: full config replacement (``config``) or
        Python transformation of an existing scene (``python_transform``).
        See the field descriptions for ``python_transform`` examples and
        the ``config`` shape contract.

        WHEN TO USE:
        - ``python_transform``: surgical edits to an existing scene
          (add/remove/update a single entity entry). Requires ``config_hash``
          from ha_config_get_scene() for optimistic locking.
        - ``config``: creating a new scene, or wholesale replacement.

        WHEN NOT TO USE:
        - To activate a scene at runtime, use ha_call_service(domain="scene",
          service="turn_on", target=...) — this tool only manages scene
          *configuration*, not the runtime turn-on/off side.
        - To list or look up existing scenes, use
          ha_search(domain_filter="scene").

        SCENE SHAPE: ``entities`` is a dict keyed by entity_id (e.g.,
        ``{'light.kitchen': {'state': 'on', 'brightness': 200}}``), NOT a
        list. Automations use a list of actions; scenes capture a snapshot
        of states as a dict.

        EXAMPLE:

        ha_config_set_scene(scene_id="movie_night", config={
            "name": "Movie Night",
            "entities": {
                "light.living_room": {"state": "on", "brightness": 50},
            },
            "icon": "mdi:movie",
        })

        this response under ``skill_content`` by default — generic
        best-practice index covering entity-naming and

        **IMPORTANT LIMITATION:**
        This tool can only delete scenes created via the Home Assistant UI.
        Scenes defined in YAML configuration files (scenes.yaml or configuration.yaml)
        cannot be deleted through the API and will return a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

        To remove YAML-defined scenes, you must edit the configuration file directly.

        **WARNING:** Deleting a scene that is referenced by automations or scripts
        (via ``scene.turn_on``) may cause those to fail.
