"""
Filesystem access tools for Home Assistant MCP Server.

This module provides tools for reading and managing files within the Home Assistant
configuration directory, enabling AI assistants to:
- Read configuration files, logs, and other allowed files
- List files in allowed directories
- Write/delete files in restricted directories (www/, themes/, custom_templates/)

**Dependency:** Requires the ha_mcp_tools custom component, added in HA via its
"HA-MCP File & YAML Tools" config entry (NOT the "HA-MCP Server" entry, which
starts a redundant in-process server). The tools will gracefully fail with
installation instructions if the component is not available.

Feature Flag: Set HAMCP_ENABLE_FILESYSTEM_TOOLS=true to enable these tools.

# get an actionable "update via HACS" error.
# 0.8.0: ``ha_config_set_yaml`` now depends on the component's
# ``themes/*.yaml`` yaml_path scope; a <0.8.0 component reaches the old
# handler and rejects ``themes/<name>.yaml`` with a misleading "not
# allowed" message instead of this actionable update prompt.
# 0.9.0: the file tools accept absolute HAOS sibling-volume paths (/share,
# /media, /ssl, /backup — issue #1586). A <0.9.0 component's allowlist
# normalizer rejects every absolute path, so adding a volume would silently
# do nothing; the version gate surfaces an actionable "update" prompt instead.
# 0.10.0: legacy-backup restore + whole-file YAML replace add new component
# services (``replace_file``, ``list_legacy_backups``, ``read_legacy_backup``)
# and a ``yaml_path`` arg on ``read_file``. A <0.10.0 component lacks these
# services; the gate surfaces an actionable "update" instead of a raw
# "service not found".
# 0.11.0: the confirm-flow + diff work (#1720) adds ``require_confirm`` /
# ``confirm_token`` args to ``edit_yaml_config`` and ``diff`` / ``written``
# response fields. The server always sends ``require_confirm`` (from
# ENABLE_YAML_EDIT_CONFIRM, default on); a <0.11.0 component's strict
# (PREVENT_EXTRA) schema rejects the unknown arg with a raw voluptuous
# error — the gate surfaces an actionable "update" prompt instead.
# 1.2.0: the YAML fragment read (#1788, PR #1882) needs two component
# behaviours that a component reports no differently from a missing key.
# ``list_files`` honours the configured packages folder, so ha_config_get_yaml's
# glob/discovery would otherwise come back "Path not allowed" instead of
# enumerating packages; and ``include_parsed`` on ``read_file`` is a new arg
# that an older strict (PREVENT_EXTRA) schema rejects with a raw voluptuous
# error. The gate turns both into the actionable "update" prompt. The floor is
# 1.2.0, not the 1.1.0 that was current when #1882 landed: #1882 added these
# behaviours under an *un-bumped* 1.1.0 component, so 1.1.0 splits into builds
# with and without them and cannot distinguish the two (#1946). 1.2.0 is the
# first component version cut after #1882, hence the first that guarantees both.

    wave calls through to now-missing services and surface raw
    service-call failures instead of the actionable error. So when the field
    is present at all, ignore its cached value and consult the live service
    registry (``_probe_tools_services``), which is memoized for
    ``_LIVE_TOOLS_PROBE_TTL_S`` — one ``get_services()`` per window, not one
    per gated call. ``None`` (a pre-2.1.0 component) keeps the old implication,
    which was sound there — only the tools entry registered ``info``.

    Caps-absent band: caps is None for a component in the 0.11.0-1.1.0 band
    (services, no info command) or an absent one, so the same live probe is the
    only signal available. It is the secondary case now — on a current
    component the probe above is the primary path — but the verdict is read
    identically. A no-services verdict raises the "File & YAML Tools entry not
    set up" error (``_raise_tools_entry_not_set_up``), not an
    install-the-component prompt — the entry-not-added state is the common
    cause (#1996).

    Must be called within a try block that handles API errors via
    exception_to_structured_error, so connection failures are classified
    correctly rather than masked as COMPONENT_NOT_INSTALLED. ``get_component_caps``
    returns None (not raises) on a transport failure, so the live
    ``get_services()`` probe still surfaces the connection error to that handler
    (a raise is never memoized — only a verdict is).

        for storage-mode items. Reach for ha_read_file only for raw on-disk text
        those tools don't expose.

        Reads files from allowed paths within the config directory. Some files
        have special handling:
        - `secrets.yaml`: Values are masked for security
        - `home-assistant.log` / `home-assistant.log.fault`: Limited to tail
          (last N lines) by default. Prefer ha_get_logs(source='error_log') and
          ha_get_logs(source='fault_log') over reading these directly.

        **Allowed Read Paths:**
        - `configuration.yaml`, `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml`, `scenes.yaml`
        - `secrets.yaml` (values masked)
        - `packages/*.yaml`
        - `home-assistant.log`, `home-assistant.log.fault` (tail only)

        **Security:**
        - Path traversal (../) is blocked
        - Only allowed paths can be read
        - Sensitive data in secrets.yaml is masked

        - success: Whether the operation succeeded
        - content: The file content (may be truncated for logs)
        - size: File size in bytes

          (null when the key is absent). Comments and HA tags (`!secret`,
          `!include`) survive as written — a `!secret` is never resolved.
