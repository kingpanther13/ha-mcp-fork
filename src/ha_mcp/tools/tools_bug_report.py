# Guidance surfaced when the reported problem is a tool that never shows up in
# the client's tool list. In issue #1804 this produced a false bug report: the
# tool was enabled and loaded server-side (startup logs even said so), but the
# MCP client had never refreshed its cached tool list, so the agent concluded
# it was a server bug. A stale client-side tool list is the single most likely
# cause of a missing tool and must be ruled out before filing.

    "newly enabled tools until the connection is refreshed. Server-side logs "
    "saying a tool is 'enabled' do NOT mean the client has loaded it. Ask the "
    "user to refresh their MCP connection first: in Claude Desktop / claude.ai "
    "use the connector's refresh option, or simply disconnect and reconnect it; "
    "in Claude Code run /mcp and reconnect the server. Only file a bug if the "

    "read tools work. Cause: Claude Desktop's manual-approval dialog for a "

    "and silently drops the call. The server never receives it. Tracked in "
    "homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp#2367 and anthropics/claude-code#92014. Tell the "
    "user to retry and wait a few seconds before clicking Allow once, or to "
    "set the write tools to Always allow (Settings -> Connectors -> the "
    "server -> Tool permissions). A dropped call never reached Home "
    "Assistant, but the same timeout can also hide a call that landed and "
    "lost only its result (anthropics/claude-code#80012), so read the target "
    "back before repeating a write that is not idempotent.\n"
    "2. Every tool call fails with 'expected nonoptional, received "
    "undefined' when an optional parameter is omitted. Cause: Claude Desktop "
    "2.110.0 rejects omitted optional MCP parameters. Tracked in "
    "homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp#2472 and anthropics/claude-code#94608 (fixed "
    "upstream). Tell the user to update Claude Desktop to 2.2553.0 or later; "

    on the 2026-07-28 protocol the SDK synthesizes them from the request's

        error messages stay in, with secrets redacted). A call
        without text still returns diagnostics, with placeholders in the body.

        before showing anything to the user: it covers the missing-tool and

These settings shape which tools the agent sees and whether a call runs, so
the same report can mean different things depending on them. Auto-collected

## 💡 Suggested Improvement

<!-- How could the agent be improved? Options: -->

- [ ] **Tool documentation** - Tool description or examples need clarification
- [ ] **Error messages** - Tool should return better guidance on failure
- [ ] **Tool design** - Tool should accept different parameters or return more info
- [ ] **Agent prompting** - System prompt should guide agent differently
- [ ] **New tool needed** - Missing functionality requires a new tool
- [ ] **Other** - Describe below

**Details:**
<!-- Explain your suggestion -->

Before submitting your bug report, please review and anonymize:

### MUST ANONYMIZE (security-sensitive):
- API tokens, passwords, secrets -> Replace with "[REDACTED]"
- IP addresses (internal/external) -> Replace with "192.168.x.x" or "[IP]"
- MAC addresses -> Replace with "[MAC]"
- Email addresses -> Replace with "user@example.com"
- Phone numbers -> Replace with "[PHONE]"

### CONSIDER ANONYMIZING (privacy-sensitive):
- Location names (city, address) -> Replace with generic names like "Home" or "[LOCATION]"
- Device names that reveal personal info -> Replace with "Device 1", "Light 1", etc.
- Person names in entity IDs -> Replace with "person.user1"
- Calendar/todo items with personal details -> Summarize without specifics

### KEEP AS-IS (helpful for debugging):
- Entity domains (light, switch, sensor, etc.)
- Device types and capabilities
- Automation/script structure (triggers, conditions, actions)
- Error messages (but check for secrets in them)
- Timestamps and durations
- State values (on/off, numeric values, etc.)
- Home Assistant and ha-mcp versions

### Example anonymization:
BEFORE: "light.juliens_bedroom" with token "eyJhbG..."
AFTER:  "light.bedroom_1" with token "[REDACTED]"

The goal is to preserve enough detail to reproduce and fix the bug
while protecting your personal information and security.
