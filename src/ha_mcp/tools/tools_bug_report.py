# tool was enabled and loaded server-side (startup logs even said so), but the
# MCP client had never refreshed its cached tool list, so the agent concluded
# it was a server bug. A stale client-side tool list is the single most likely

    "newly enabled tools until the connection is refreshed. Server-side logs "

    "user to refresh their MCP connection first: in Claude Desktop / claude.ai "

    "and silently drops the call. The server never receives it. Tracked in "

    "user to retry and wait a few seconds before clicking Allow once, or to "
    "set the write tools to Always allow (Settings -> Connectors -> the "
    "server -> Tool permissions). A dropped call never reached Home "
    "Assistant, but the same timeout can also hide a call that landed and "
    "lost only its result (anthropics/claude-code#80012), so read the target "
    "back before repeating a write that is not idempotent.\n"
    "2. Every tool call fails with 'expected nonoptional, received "
    "undefined' when an optional parameter is omitted. Cause: Claude Desktop "
    "2.110.0 rejects omitted optional MCP parameters. Tracked in "
    "homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp#2472 and anthropics/claude-code#94608 (fixed "

        Use it before filing any GitHub issue about ha-mcp: a bug report
        without this report is closed after 24 hours. `report_type` picks
        the kind of report; if it is unclear which, ask: "Are you reporting a
        bug in ha-mcp, giving feedback on how I used the tools, or requesting
        a feature?"

        Pass the report text in the call: the server combines it with the
        diagnostics it collects into `issue_title`, `issue_body` (the full
        report with logs) and `issue_url` (a new-issue link with title and
        body filled in, log sections left out to fit GitHub's URL limit;
        error messages stay in, with secrets redacted). A call
        without text still returns diagnostics, with placeholders in the body.

        The response is LARGE; `fields=` narrows it. Read `instructions`
        before showing anything to the user: it covers the missing-tool and
        known-client pre-checks, the duplicate check, the mandatory
        anonymisation step, and how to file the issue. Check
        `missing_tool_hint` FIRST when the report is about a missing tool: a
        stale client tool list (not a bug) is the usual cause.

Before submitting your bug report, please review and anonymize:

### MUST ANONYMIZE (security-sensitive):
- API tokens, passwords, secrets -> Replace with "[REDACTED]"
- IP addresses (internal/external) -> Replace with "192.168.x.x" or "[IP]"
- MAC addresses -> Replace with "[MAC]"
- Email addresses -> Replace with "user@example.com"
- Phone numbers -> Replace with "[PHONE]"

### CONSIDER ANONYMIZING (privacy-sensitive):
- Location names (city, address) -> Replace with generic names like "Home" or "[LOCATION]"
- Device names that reveal personal info -> Replace with "Device 1", "Light 1", etc.
- Person names in entity IDs -> Replace with "person.user1"
- Calendar/todo items with personal details -> Summarize without specifics

### KEEP AS-IS (helpful for debugging):
- Entity domains (light, switch, sensor, etc.)
- Device types and capabilities
- Automation/script structure (triggers, conditions, actions)
- Error messages (but check for secrets in them)
- Timestamps and durations
- State values (on/off, numeric values, etc.)
- Home Assistant and ha-mcp versions

### Example anonymization:
BEFORE: "light.juliens_bedroom" with token "eyJhbG..."
AFTER:  "light.bedroom_1" with token "[REDACTED]"

The goal is to preserve enough detail to reproduce and fix the bug
while protecting your personal information and security.
