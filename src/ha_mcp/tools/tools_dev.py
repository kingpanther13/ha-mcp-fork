Developer-mode tools for managing the ha-mcp server itself.

These tools are hidden behind the ``enable_dev_mode`` setting (the
"Developer" section at the bottom of the web settings UI's Server
Settings tab, or the ``HAMCP_ENABLE_DEV_MODE`` env var). When the flag
is off — the default — ``register_dev_tools`` registers nothing, so the
tools do not exist for MCP clients at all.

        Settings matrix, the Tools tab, the Tool Security Policies editor,
        and agent-editable backup config. Snapshot Actions and Backup Read
        Only are human-only controls. Use ha_dev_manage_server for
        the live approval queue and to restart.

        When NOT to use: for HA entity/automation configuration use the
        ha_config_* tools.

        Caveats: enable/disable/pin and most server settings take effect
        only after a restart (ha_dev_manage_server action="restart");
        LLM-API exposure, security gates, and policy edits apply live.
        Env-pinned settings/tools are read-only until the env var is unset.
        These actions can flip security-sensitive state — treat with the
        same care as editing the web UI. The policy-override surfaces
        (set_policy, set_tool with gated=, and set/reset of
        enable_tool_security_policies) additionally require the
        'dev_tools_security_policy_access' setting, which is off by
        default; reads are always available. That setting itself is never
        writable by these tools — change it in the web settings UI or via
        HAMCP_DEV_SECURITY_POLICY_ACCESS.

        update Home Assistant Apps (add-ons) or HACS packages use
        ha_manage_app / ha_manage_hacs.

        Caveats: update_source changes ONLY the ha_mcp_tools custom
        component's separate in-process server entry — it never updates
        the app (add-on), Docker, standalone, or PyPI server that may be
        serving this connection (update those via ha_manage_app /
        docker pull / pip). In embedded mode that entry IS this server,
        so the update self-interrupts; elsewhere this connection is
        untouched and keeps its current version. Success means the
        entry's options were applied — the component then reinstalls in
        the background, which can take minutes and can still fail
        (check HA logs). update_source requires the component's
        in-process server entry to exist. restart interrupts this MCP
        connection in embedded and app deployments (the reply
        arrives just before the server goes down) and supports those
        two deployments only (standalone processes must be restarted
        externally). approve/deny require the separate
        'dev_tools_security_policy_access' setting, off by default.
