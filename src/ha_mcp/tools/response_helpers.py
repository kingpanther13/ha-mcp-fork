    Returns ``(projected_record, warning_string | None)``.  *warning_string* is
    non-None when ``attribute_keys`` was specified, the original ``attributes``
    dict was non-empty, and the filter produced an empty result — i.e. the caller
    supplied only unknown attribute keys (typo guard).  Callers should append the
    warning to the response ``warnings`` list so the user receives a diagnostic

    must be normalised at the call site via ``parse_string_list_param`` (see
    ``ha_get_state`` which parses once before the bulk loop to avoid re-parsing per

    Unlike ``project_fields``, this helper does not auto-retain ``success`` — entity
    records have no ``success`` field, so the asymmetry is intentional.

    Non-dict ``attributes`` handling: when ``attribute_keys`` is set but the
    record's ``attributes`` value is not a dict (``None``, scalar, list — rare
    from HA's state API but possible from malformed records, partial error
    payloads, or mocked fixtures), the key-set filter cannot be applied. A
    ``warning``-level log line records the short-circuit AND a caller-facing
    warning is returned via ``attr_warn`` so the agent (MCP consumer) sees that
