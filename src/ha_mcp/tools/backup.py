"""
Backup and restore tools for Home Assistant MCP Server.

Provides the polymorphic ``ha_manage_backup`` tool, which handles both:

* **Full HA snapshots** (``scope="snapshot"``) — the original
  ``ha_backup_create`` / ``ha_backup_restore`` functionality. Heavy
  tarball creation via HA's native backup integration; restore restarts
  HA. Last-resort recovery.
* **Per-edit auto-backups** (``scope="edits"``) — list / view / restore
  / delete operations against the per-entity snapshots produced by the
  ``@with_auto_backup`` decorator (#1288). Lightweight, no HA restart.

The merge consolidates the previous two tools so the LLM cannot
accidentally route "restore my automation" through the heavyweight full
HA restore path. Each call must explicitly pick its scope.

# the client-side abort reported in #1861 (an MCP client that received no

# not by this constant. Raising it from 300 to 1800 instead fixes *our own*
# poll loop giving up on a legitimately >5-minute backup — the job keeps
# running server-side after our loop times out, so a too-tight ceiling here
# means _poll_backup_completion raises TIMEOUT_OPERATION on a backup that
# would otherwise have succeeded. 120s before that underfit slow HA
# instances too (#1433: poll loop exited while HA was still in

    Supervisor options; an agent cannot enable this itself. Layered guards
    beyond the gate, applied in order:

    1. ``confirm=True`` is required.
    2. ``backup/info`` must not report ``agent_errors`` — evaluated before
       the "does it exist" check right below, since an agent that failed
       to enumerate its backups could make that list (and every guard
       below) incomplete. The backup must then exist (verified against
       ``backup/info``, mirroring ``restore_backup`` — HA's own
       ``backup/delete`` silently no-ops on an unknown ID rather than
       erroring).
    3. Scheduled backups (``with_automatic_settings=True``) are never
       deletable. Fails closed the same way when HA can't confirm the
       backup is manual (``with_automatic_settings=None`` — not created
       by this HA instance, or predates this metadata field): only an
       explicit ``False`` is treated as deletable.
    4. The single newest remaining snapshot, of any type, is never
       deletable — guarantees at least one recovery point always survives.
       Checked before the age floor below so a backup that is both the
       newest AND too young reports "newest" (with its own remedy), not
       a "too young" message whose suggested remedy (lower the floor)
       would not actually unblock it.
    5. The target must be older than ``snapshot_delete_min_age_days`` (0
       unconditionally disables this floor, even across clock skew between
       this host and the HA instance that stamped the backup's date). A
       missing/unparseable date fails closed (treated as too new to delete).

    The actual ``backup/delete`` call uses an elevated WS wait timeout
    (``_BACKUP_DELETE_WAIT_S``) since it fans out to every configured agent
    — including slow/rate-limited remote ones — server-side. ``ctx``, when
    supplied, receives one ``report_progress`` heartbeat immediately before
    that call.

**Pick the scope first**, then the action. Wrong scope routes through the wrong code path:

| scope | action | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `snapshot` | `create` | Create a full HA tarball (config + addons, no DB by default). Can take a while on a large instance; progress heartbeats are sent while waiting. |
| `snapshot` | `list` | List full HA tarball snapshots (id, name, date, size). Read-only — use to discover a `backup_id` or confirm a backup landed. |
| `snapshot` | `restore` | Restore a full HA tarball. **Restarts HA.** Last-resort recovery. |
| `snapshot` | `delete` | Delete one full HA tarball by `backup_id` (`confirm=True` required). **Disabled by default** (`enable_snapshot_delete` setting) and layered with guards even when enabled — see below. |
| `edits` | `create` | On-demand snapshot of one entity (`domain` + `entity_id` required). Use before the user manually edits in the HA UI. Same handler path the decorator takes on writes; bypasses the `enable_auto_backup` toggle. |
| `edits` | `list` | List per-entity auto-backups (lightweight). Filter by `domain` and/or `entity_id`. |
| `edits` | `view` | Read one auto-backup file by name; returns YAML and parsed `config`. |
| `edits` | `diff` | Compare one auto-backup against the entity's current config. RFC 6902 JSON-Patch + add/remove/replace counts; bounded output. Read-only — fetches the live config, makes no changes. |
| `edits` | `restore` | Re-apply one auto-backup. Existing Template helpers require a fresh safety snapshot; other domains follow auto-backup settings and may proceed without one. A deleted Template helper is recreated with a new config-entry ID; its saved entity ID is restored if unoccupied. **No HA restart.** |
| `edits` | `delete` | Delete one auto-backup by `backup_name`, or bulk-delete by filter. |

**When to use which scope:**
- Use `scope="edits"` to undo a recent automation/script/scene/dashboard/helper edit by the agent. Lightweight, fast, no restart.
- Use `scope="snapshot"` only for system-wide recovery (botched add-on update, mass config corruption, etc.).

**`scope="snapshot"` backup-hint:**
{backup_hint_text}

**`(snapshot, delete)` is off by default and layered even when enabled:** a human must
set `enable_snapshot_delete=true` (env var, web settings UI, or add-on Supervisor
options) — an agent cannot turn this on itself. When enabled, a delete call is still
refused if: the target is a scheduled/automatic backup; it's younger than
`snapshot_delete_min_age_days` (default 7, 0 disables the floor); or it's the single
newest snapshot remaining. These guarantee at least one recovery point always
survives an agent's own mistakes.

**Human-managed backup controls:** `enable_snapshot_actions=false` (ENABLE_SNAPSHOT_ACTIONS) blocks every snapshot action, including listing. `backup_read_only=true` (BACKUP_READ_ONLY) allows edits list/view/diff and snapshot list when snapshots are enabled; it blocks explicit create/restore/delete in both scopes. Automatic pre-edit capture still follows `enable_auto_backup`. A human must change these controls in the Backups tab, app configuration, or environment; developer tools cannot change them. Global and connection Read Only Mode still restrict writes.

**`enable_auto_backup` and `scope="edits"`:** the automatic-on-write capture (every wrapped tool call) is gated by `enable_auto_backup=true` — if the listing is empty, check the toggle (web settings UI or `ENABLE_AUTO_BACKUP=true` env var). The explicit `(edits, create)` action bypasses the toggle since the request is explicit; `list` / `view` / `restore` / `delete` operate on whatever's already on disk regardless of the toggle's current state.

**Template filters:** `edits.create` accepts a Template entity ID and returns its stable config-entry ID as `entity_id`. Use that returned ID for `edits.list` and bulk `edits.delete`; those filters do not resolve entity aliases. After recreation, the restore result reports the replacement config-entry ID and `entity_id_mapping` separately.

**Examples:**
- Snapshot before risky op: `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="create", name="Before_Big_Change")`
- List snapshots (to discover a backup_id or confirm one landed): `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="list")`
- Restore full snapshot: `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="restore", backup_id="dd7550ed")`
- Delete an old snapshot (requires `enable_snapshot_delete=true`): `ha_manage_backup(scope="snapshot", action="delete", backup_id="dd7550ed", confirm=True)`
- On-demand entity snapshot before a manual UI edit: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="create", domain="helper_input_boolean", entity_id="kitchen_lights_active")`
- List recent auto-backups for one automation: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="list", domain="automation", entity_id="kitchen_lights")`
- View an auto-backup: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="view", backup_name="automation.kitchen_lights.20260521_153000.yaml")`
- Diff an auto-backup vs current state: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="diff", backup_name="automation.kitchen_lights.20260521_153000.yaml")`
- Restore an auto-backup: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="restore", backup_name="automation.kitchen_lights.20260521_153000.yaml")`
- Delete one auto-backup: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="delete", backup_name="...")`
- Bulk-delete old auto-backups: `ha_manage_backup(scope="edits", action="delete", older_than_days=30)`
