# Webhook Proxy for HA MCP - Documentation

Remote access proxy for the Home Assistant MCP Server addon via webhooks.

## About

This addon enables remote access to your HA MCP Server through any reverse proxy — Nabu Casa, Cloudflare, DuckDNS, nginx, or any other. It does **not** run its own MCP server; instead it discovers your existing MCP Server addon (stable or dev) and proxies requests to it via a Home Assistant webhook.

## Only one Webhook Proxy flavor runs at a time

This add-on and its development counterpart, **Nabu Casa - Webhook Proxy for HA MCP
(Dev)**, cannot run at the same time — they would collide over Home Assistant's root
OAuth `/authorize` and `/token` routes. If you start this add-on while the **(Dev)**
add-on is running, it refuses to start (a clear error in the add-on log plus a Home
Assistant notification). Stop the (Dev) add-on first; the notification clears
automatically on the next clean start.

## Prerequisites

- **Home Assistant MCP Server** addon must be installed and running (stable or dev channel)
- For Nabu Casa auto-detection: active Nabu Casa subscription with remote UI enabled
- For other setups: a working reverse proxy pointing at your HA instance

## Setup

1. **Install this addon** from the add-on store
2. **Start the addon** — on first run it will install the integration and create a notification asking you to restart Home Assistant
3. **Restart Home Assistant** (Settings > System > Restart) — the addon detects the restart and automatically finishes setup
4. **Copy the remote URL** from the addon logs:
   ```
   MCP Server URL (remote): https://xxxxx.ui.nabu.casa/api/webhook/mcp_xxxxxxxx
   ```
5. **Paste the URL** into your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude.ai, Open WebUI, etc.)

### Connecting from Claude.ai (web)

1. In Claude.ai, go to **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, give it a name, paste the remote URL, and click **Add**.
2. **Click _Connect_ on the new connector.** This step is required — adding the connector does not connect it. With OAuth enabled this opens the consent page; click **Allow** to finish. (With OAuth off there is no consent page and it connects directly.)
3. Claude.ai may briefly show *"Couldn't reach the MCP server"* — this is often a harmless artifact of the initial handshake. Check whether the connector actually shows as connected before assuming it failed.

> **Reachability check:** Claude.ai connects from Anthropic's servers, not from your computer — so the URL must be reachable from the public internet, not just your LAN. If a connection won't establish, open the remote URL on your **phone with Wi-Fi turned off** (cellular only). If it doesn't load there, the URL isn't publicly reachable (a DNS, port-forward, TLS, or reverse-proxy problem) and Claude.ai can't reach it either — fix that first.

> **Recreate the connector when OAuth or the URL changes.** Claude.ai binds an
> authentication mode to a connector when you add it, and caches it. If you
> later **turn OAuth on or off**, or the **webhook URL changes** (you rotated
> it, or reinstalled the addon — which generates a new URL), the existing
> connector keeps using the old mode/URL and tool calls fail (often
> `invalid client id` on the consent page, or a silently dead endpoint).
> **Delete the connector in Claude.ai and add a fresh one** with the current
> URL (and current OAuth Client ID/Secret, if OAuth is on). This is required
> even when going from OAuth on → off.

> **Note:** If something doesn't seem to work after restarting HA, try restarting the addon as well.

## Configuration

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `remote_url` | Your external URL (auto-detects Nabu Casa if blank) | `""` |
| `mcp_server_url` | Full MCP server URL override (auto-detects if blank) | `""` |
| `mcp_port` | MCP server port used during auto-discovery | `9583` |
| `enable_oauth` | **Beta.** Require OAuth 2.1 on the webhook URL | `false` |
| `oauth_client_id` | OAuth Client ID (auto-generated if blank) | `""` |
| `oauth_client_secret` | OAuth Client Secret (auto-generated if blank) | `""` |
| `regenerate_oauth_creds` | One-shot: wipe stored OAuth creds and generate fresh ones on next start | `false` |
| `debug_logging` | **Beta.** Log every inbound request to the Home Assistant log to confirm a client is reaching the server | `false` |

> The OAuth options are hidden by default. Toggle **Show unused optional configuration options** at the bottom of the addon's Configuration tab to reveal them. `debug_logging` is shown on the main Configuration page (it is not one of the hidden options).

### Auto-detection

When `mcp_server_url` is left blank (recommended), the addon automatically:

1. Finds the running MCP Server addon (tries stable `ha_mcp` first, then dev `ha_mcp_dev`)
2. Gets its container IP address from the Supervisor API
3. Discovers the secret path from the addon's options or logs
4. Constructs the target URL: `http://<ip>:<port>/<secret_path>`

### Manual URL override

If auto-detection doesn't work for your setup (e.g. non-standard port, custom networking), set `mcp_server_url` to the full MCP server URL:

```
http://192.168.1.100:9583/private_zctpwlX7ZkIAr7oqdfLPxw
```

### Remote URL

- **Nabu Casa subscribers**: Leave `remote_url` blank — auto-detected from cloud storage
- **Cloudflare/DuckDNS/nginx**: Set `remote_url` to your external URL (e.g. `https://ha.example.com`)

### Authentication

By default the webhook URL is **unauthenticated** — possession of the URL is the only credential, and the URL functions as a shared bearer secret. The MCP server exposed through the proxy includes powerful Home Assistant control tools, so you should **treat the URL like a password**.

#### Treat the URL as a secret (default mode)

- **Don't share the URL** in screenshots, chat transcripts, log paste-bins, or public configs. Mask the path segment after `/api/webhook/` if you need to share anything.
- **Avoid copying it into untrusted clients.** Anyone with the full URL can call your MCP tools.
- **Rotate immediately if you suspect it leaked.** See below.

#### Rotating the webhook URL

The URL stays the same across addon restarts because the webhook ID is persisted at `/data/webhook_id.txt` inside the addon container. To rotate:

1. **Stop** the Webhook Proxy addon.
2. **Delete** the persisted webhook ID file. Open the addon's filesystem (e.g. via the SSH/Terminal addon or a file browser) and remove `/data/webhook_id.txt` for the proxy addon. (Stopping then uninstalling and reinstalling the addon also achieves this.)
3. **Start** the addon. A fresh webhook ID and URL are generated on first launch.
4. **Copy the new URL** from the addon logs and paste it into your MCP client(s). The old URL is now dead.

The old webhook ID is not retained anywhere on disk after the file is deleted, and the integration's previous registration is dropped when the addon stops.

#### Enable OAuth (Beta) for stronger protection

If you want a real auth layer on top of the URL secret, turn on **Enable OAuth (Beta)**. It is OFF by default; leaving it off keeps the webhook working exactly as before with no auth check.

There are two modes, chosen with the **OAuth Mode (Beta)** option:

- **`ha_auth` (recommended, the default for a first-time enable)** — Home Assistant itself is the authorization server. You sign in with your Home Assistant account and **leave the connector's OAuth fields blank**. No Client ID or Client Secret, works with any hostname/URL, and no Home Assistant restart is needed to enable or disable it.
- **`legacy` (deprecated)** — the previous flow, where the add-on generates a Client ID + Secret you paste into the connector.

> **Upgrading? Your OAuth setup is not changed.** If you already used the legacy flow (you set a Client ID/Secret, or the add-on stored one), leaving **OAuth Mode** unset keeps you on **legacy** — nothing breaks. New/first-time enables default to **ha_auth**. Switching modes is an explicit action (set **OAuth Mode**) and, because Claude.ai binds the auth mode per connector, requires **deleting and re-adding your MCP connector**.

##### Recommended: sign in with Home Assistant (`ha_auth`)

1. Toggle **Show unused optional configuration options** at the bottom of the Configuration tab.
2. Set **Enable OAuth (Beta)** to on. Leave **OAuth Mode** unset (or set it to `ha_auth`) for a first-time enable.
3. Save and **restart the addon**. (No Home Assistant restart is required for this mode.)
4. In your MCP client, add the connector with the webhook URL and **leave the OAuth Client ID and Client Secret fields blank**. When you connect, you sign in with your Home Assistant account and approve access — that is the whole flow.
   - **Claude.ai:** if its UI insists on a Client Secret, any value works — Home Assistant ignores it.
5. **Revoking access:** open your Home Assistant profile and remove the session/refresh token for the connector (Settings → your user → Security). No add-on action needed.

Why this mode is host-agnostic: the add-on serves the OAuth discovery documents itself, so they work on any hostname even when Home Assistant's own metadata would not (e.g. an external URL mismatch). All the actual OAuth protocol steps are Home Assistant core's own `/auth/authorize` + `/auth/token`.

##### Legacy mode (client id + secret)

Set **OAuth Mode** to `legacy` (or leave it unset if you are upgrading an existing legacy setup). The add-on runs a minimal OAuth 2.1 authorization-code-with-PKCE flow on the same webhook URL, discoverable from a 401 response, with a one-screen consent page.

1. Toggle **Show unused optional configuration options** at the bottom of the Configuration tab.
2. Set **Enable OAuth (Beta)** to on and **OAuth Mode** to `legacy`. Leave **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** blank — the addon will generate strong values for you on first start.
3. Save and **restart the addon**. Legacy mode requires a full **Home Assistant** restart to take effect (a Repair with a restart button appears); disabling does not.
4. Open the addon log and copy the displayed Client ID and Client Secret. Both values are printed in plaintext exactly as Claude.ai needs them — copy them straight from the log:
   ```
   OAuth (Beta) is ENABLED for this URL (legacy mode).
     OAuth Client ID:     hamcp-1a2b3c4d5e6f7890abcdef1234567890
     OAuth Client Secret: kX9pQ4mZ2vL8nR3sT6uW1yA5cB7dF0gH...
     Paste both into the OAuth fields of your MCP client's
     connector setup (Claude.ai: connector → Advanced settings).
   ```
5. In your MCP client, configure the OAuth fields:
   - **Claude.ai:** when adding the connector, expand **Advanced settings** and paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the OAuth fields. Claude.ai completes the rest automatically (consent screen → token exchange → bearer token).
   - **Other clients:** configure the same Client ID + Client Secret in the client's OAuth settings if it supports OAuth 2.1 with manual client registration.

The generated values are persisted at `/data/oauth_creds.json` inside the addon, so they stay the same across restarts.

**Rotating the legacy credentials** — three options:

1. **Pick your own new values:** type new strings into the Client ID and Client Secret fields, save, restart the addon. Your values overwrite the persisted file. Update your MCP client to match.
2. **Get fresh random values via the UI** (no filesystem access needed): turn on **Regenerate OAuth Credentials on Next Start** in the addon configuration, save, restart. The addon wipes the stored creds, generates a fresh pair, prints them in the log, and flips the regenerate toggle back to off. Update your MCP client to match.
3. **Get fresh random values manually:** stop the addon, delete `/data/oauth_creds.json` (e.g. via SSH/Terminal addon), start the addon. Equivalent to option 2 but requires filesystem access.

**To disable OAuth (either mode):** set **Enable OAuth (Beta)** back to off and restart the addon. The webhook returns to plain unauthenticated behavior — the URL works as before with no token required.

**Endpoints exposed when enabled:**

Both modes serve the discovery documents from the add-on's own host, so they work on any hostname:

- `/.../api/webhook/<id>` — MCP webhook (now bearer-protected)
- `/.../api/mcp_proxy_dev/oauth/protected-resource` — RFC 9728 metadata
- `/.../api/mcp_proxy_dev/oauth/authorization-server` — RFC 8414 metadata (contents differ per mode)

The authorize/token endpoints depend on the mode:

- **`ha_auth`:** Home Assistant core's own `/auth/authorize` + `/auth/token`. The add-on registers no root routes and needs no HA restart.
- **`legacy`:** the add-on's own `/.../authorize` (consent screen) + `/.../token` at the host root, where Claude.ai expects them.

**Notes (legacy mode):**

- Tokens are HMAC-signed and stateless — they survive HA restarts. Access tokens expire after 1 hour; refresh tokens after 30 days.
- Rotating the Client ID invalidates all outstanding tokens (the client_id is part of the token's signed payload).
- The signing key is generated once and persisted at `/config/.mcp_proxy_dev_oauth_secret`. Delete that file to invalidate every token in one shot.

**Beta status:** OAuth is Beta in both modes; the URL-as-secret mode (default) is the stable, documented path. `ha_auth` delegates all protocol steps to Home Assistant's own OAuth (validated live against claude.ai); `legacy` is implemented against the [MCP 2025-06-18 spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization). Real-world MCP-client coverage varies, so treat OAuth as opt-in until tested with your client, and report problems on GitHub.

### End-to-end flow (what happens when Claude.ai connects)

When OAuth is enabled and you paste the webhook URL + Client ID + Client Secret into Claude.ai's connector setup, here's what happens after you click **Connect** on the connector:

1. **Claude.ai's browser session** is redirected to `https://<your-host>/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&code_challenge=...&code_challenge_method=S256&state=...&resource=https://<your-host>/api/webhook/<id>`.
2. The addon serves a **consent page** (Allow / Deny) showing the redirect destination so you can verify it's Claude.ai's callback URL before proceeding.
3. You click **Allow** → the addon issues a one-time auth code and redirects the browser back to Claude.ai's callback (`redirect_uri`).
4. Claude.ai's backend exchanges the auth code at `https://<your-host>/token` using the configured Client ID and Client Secret (Basic auth or form body) plus the PKCE `code_verifier`. The addon validates all of these, then issues:
   - An **access token** (1-hour HMAC-signed bearer)
   - A **refresh token** (30-day HMAC-signed bearer)
5. Claude.ai stores the tokens. From then on, every MCP request includes `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`. The webhook handler validates the bearer; expired tokens are refreshed automatically using the refresh token.

### Threat model and the role of the Client Secret

The `/authorize` consent page is reachable without being logged into Home Assistant or Nabu Casa. **This is intentional and matches how mainstream OAuth servers work** — the consent page must be reachable by the browser session being redirected from the OAuth client (Claude.ai), which has no Home Assistant credentials of its own.

What stops an attacker who can reach the consent page from gaining access:

- Clicking **Allow** on a maliciously-crafted authorize URL only mints a one-time auth code bound to the attacker's `redirect_uri` and PKCE `code_challenge`.
- That code is **useless without the OAuth Client Secret**, which is required at the `/token` endpoint to complete the exchange.
- PKCE binds the code to the original `code_verifier`, which only the legitimate client (Claude.ai) generated.

**This means: the OAuth Client Secret is the actual security boundary.** Treat it like a password.

**Where the Client Secret lives:**

- The addon log on each start (plaintext for copying into Claude.ai)
- The addon's persistent storage at `/data/oauth_creds.json`
- Claude.ai's backend (after you paste it into the connector setup)
- Anywhere you've recorded it (password manager, etc.)

**Keep the Client Secret safe:**

- Don't share the addon log publicly without redacting the OAuth Client Secret line.
- Don't paste it into chat transcripts, screenshots, support threads, or public configs.
- If you suspect it has leaked, **rotate it immediately** using one of the three rotation methods above. After rotation, the old Client Secret stops working — any tokens previously issued will fail at refresh, forcing the client to re-do the OAuth flow with the new credentials.
- If you can't tell whether it leaked but want a clean slate (e.g., after sharing logs for debugging, after a migration), rotating proactively is cheap: flip **Regenerate OAuth Credentials on Next Start**, restart, paste the new credentials into Claude.ai. Takes ~30 seconds.

### Debugging connections (log inbound requests)

If a client (e.g. Claude.ai) can't connect and you can't tell whether its requests are even reaching Home Assistant, turn on **Log inbound requests** (the `debug_logging` option on the main Configuration page) and **restart the addon**.

When it's on, every request that hits the webhook is logged to the **Home Assistant log** (requests reach Home Assistant directly rather than passing through the addon process). View them at **Settings → System → Logs** (or filter for `mcp_proxy`). The same lines are also **mirrored into this addon's own log**, so you can watch them on the addon's Log tab without leaving the addon page. Each line shows the method, a masked webhook path, the source address, whether an `Authorization` header was present, and the upstream response status:

```
MCP Proxy [inbound]: POST /api/webhook/mcp_3e... from 203.0.113.4 (Authorization header: present)
MCP Proxy [inbound]: -> upstream responded 200 (text/event-stream)
```

How to read it:

- **You see inbound lines** → the client is reaching the server; the problem is downstream (auth, the client's config, or the MCP server itself).
- **You see nothing** → the request never arrived. The problem is network reachability — the public URL, DNS, TLS, or your reverse proxy — not this addon. See the reachability check under [Setup](#connecting-from-claudeai-web).

Turn it back off for normal operation (restart the addon after changing it).

## How it works

1. The addon installs a lightweight `mcp_proxy` custom integration into Home Assistant
2. By default this integration registers an **unauthenticated** webhook endpoint (`/api/webhook/<id>`) — the URL itself is the shared secret
3. When a request hits the webhook, it is proxied to the MCP server addon (after a bearer-token check, if **Enable OAuth** is on)
4. The addon stays alive with a periodic health check loop

The webhook bypasses the ingress session cookie requirement that external MCP clients cannot provide.

## Troubleshooting

### "No running MCP addon found"

The main MCP Server addon is not running. Install and start it first:
- Settings > Add-ons > Home Assistant MCP Server > Start

### "Could not discover secret path"

The addon could not find the secret path. Options:
1. Check that the MCP Server addon has started successfully and shows a URL in its logs
2. Set `mcp_server_url` manually in this addon's configuration

### "MCP server unreachable"

The health check cannot reach the MCP server. Check:
1. The MCP Server addon is still running
2. No network/firewall issues between addons
3. The port matches (default 9583)

### Integration not loading

If the `mcp_proxy` integration doesn't appear in Settings > Devices & Services:
1. Restart Home Assistant (Settings > System > Restart)
2. The addon will start automatically and retry setup

### Persistent errors, especially OAuth "Invalid client id"

If the proxy keeps returning the same error — most notably **"Invalid client id"**
on the OAuth consent page even though you pasted the correct Client ID — **fully
restart Home Assistant** (Settings → System → Restart).

The OAuth provider's HTTP views are bound into Home Assistant's HTTP layer when the
integration first loads, and Home Assistant can't re-register or drop them on a
config reload. So changes that come from **toggling OAuth on/off, regenerating
credentials, or reinstalling the add-on** don't take effect until a full HA
restart — *reloading the integration or restarting the add-on is not enough.* (The
webhook endpoint itself is re-registered on every reload, so it's specifically the
OAuth views that need the restart.) After the restart, re-add the Claude.ai
connector with the current URL (and current Client ID/Secret, if OAuth is on).

### Claude.ai says "Couldn't reach the MCP server"

Three cases:

1. **It actually connected.** Claude.ai sometimes shows this during the initial handshake even though the connector ends up working. Check whether the connector shows as connected before assuming failure.
2. **It genuinely can't reach the URL.** Claude.ai connects from Anthropic's servers, so the URL must be reachable from the public internet — not just your LAN. Open the remote URL on your **phone with Wi-Fi off** (cellular): if it doesn't load, the URL isn't publicly reachable (DNS / port-forward / TLS / reverse-proxy) and Claude.ai can't reach it either. To confirm whether requests are arriving at all, enable **Log inbound requests** (see [Debugging connections](#debugging-connections-log-inbound-requests)).
3. **The URL is reachable, but your proxy blocks AI clients.** If the URL loads in a browser but the LLM still can't connect, your reverse proxy is filtering the AI client — see [Cloudflare users: browser works but the LLM can't connect](#cloudflare-users-browser-works-but-the-llm-cant-connect) below (Cloudflare's "Block AI training bots" setting and geo / country blocking are the usual causes).

> **Note:** A connection working in Claude Code or a local browser but **not** in Claude.ai web is the classic signature of this — those reach your box over the LAN, while Claude.ai reaches it from the public internet.

### Cloudflare users: browser works but the LLM can't connect

If your remote URL goes through Cloudflare and the URL loads fine in your browser but your AI/LLM client still can't connect, check these two settings:

**1. "Block AI training bots"** — the most common connection issue for Cloudflare users. Cloudflare blocks requests from AI/LLM clients by default. To disable it:

1. Log in to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. In the left sidebar, click **Domains**, then click **Overview**
3. Click on the domain you use for connecting to Home Assistant
4. On the right side of the page, find **"Control AI Crawlers"**
5. Under **"Block AI training bots"**, open the dropdown
6. Select **"do not block (allow crawlers)"**

![Cloudflare AI Crawlers Setting](https://homeassistant-ai.github.io/ha-mcp/images/cloudflare-ai-crawlers-setting.jpg)

See [#783](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/issues/783) for more details.

**2. Geo / country blocking** — applies to any reverse proxy, not just Cloudflare. Most AI/LLM services connect from US-based cloud infrastructure, so if you block US IP addresses (or only allow your own country), your client cannot connect. Allow your AI provider's IP ranges — Claude.ai connects from Anthropic's network, `160.79.104.0/21` (see [Anthropic's IP ranges](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/ip-addresses)). Your proxy's access logs will show the blocked attempts.

## Disabling / Uninstalling

- **Stopping** the addon is safe — the webhook URL stays the same and resumes working when the addon is restarted
- **Reinstalling** the addon always changes the webhook URL. Uninstalling wipes the addon's `/data` (where `webhook_id.txt` is stored), so the next start generates a fresh webhook id and overwrites `/config/.mcp_proxy_dev_config.json` with it. Update your MCP client (and re-add the Claude.ai connector) with the new URL afterwards.
- **Uninstalling** the addon does not automatically remove the custom integration files. To fully clean up after uninstalling:
  1. Delete `/config/custom_components/mcp_proxy_dev/`
  2. Delete `/config/.mcp_proxy_dev_config.json`
  3. Delete `/config/.mcp_proxy_inbound.log` (only present if you used **Log inbound requests**; normally removed when the addon stops)
  4. Restart Home Assistant
