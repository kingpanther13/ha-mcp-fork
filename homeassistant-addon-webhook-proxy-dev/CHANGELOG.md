# CHANGELOG

<!-- version list -->

<!--
Dev channel: forked from the stable Webhook Proxy add-on at v1.2.2 and versioned
independently (1.2.2.dev1, 1.2.2.dev2, …). The entries below are inherited stable
history from before the fork.
-->


## v3.0.4.dev2 (2026-09-13)

- Add `/api/webhook/<id>/readonly` connections using the existing authentication.
  Requires an MCP server with read-only endpoint support.

## v3.0.4.dev1 (2026-09-13)

Version line rebased onto stable 3.0.3 by the promotion workflow. The discovery
security and OAuth compatibility fixes, Claude.ai setup updates, and OAuth
cleanup developed through 3.0.3.dev4 now ship in stable 3.0.3. See the
[stable release notes](../homeassistant-addon-webhook-proxy/CHANGELOG.md#v303-2026-09-13)
for details and webhook-rotation guidance. Dev and stable runtime code are
equivalent apart from flavor identity at this promotion.


## v3.0.3.dev2 (2026-08-30)

### Security

- The webhook id is no longer published by any anonymous discovery URL. The
  fixed-path protected-resource document (`/api/mcp_proxy_dev/oauth/protected-resource`)
  handed the full webhook URL to any unauthenticated GET while `ha_auth` or
  `legacy` mode was on; it is removed. The webhook's 401 challenge now points at
  the RFC 9728 path-scoped document, whose URL already contains the id.
- After the operator rotates the webhook id (`/data/webhook_id.txt`), the old
  id's discovery URL stops answering immediately instead of serving the new id
  until the next Home Assistant restart. A restart Repair is raised so the new
  id's discovery URL gets bound; existing installs that ran `ha_auth` or `legacy`
  reachable from the internet before this version may wish to rotate once.

### Bug Fixes

- `ha_auth`: percent-encode the query forwarded to core's `/auth/authorize`, so a
  native-app client's loopback callback is not rejected by reverse proxies that
  block `=http://` in query strings (Nginx Proxy Manager "Block Common Exploits").


## v3.0.1.dev1 (2026-08-16)

Version line rebased onto the 3.0.0 stable base by the promote PR
(`rebase_dev_version`). The OAuth surface overhaul developed on this channel as
2.1.1.dev4 and .dev5 shipped in stable 3.0.0 — see the stable CHANGELOG for the
user-facing notes; dev and stable are code-identical as of that promotion.


## v2.1.1.dev3 (2026-07-31)

Internal: lint cleanup (ruff pylint rules) — no behavior change.


## v2.1.1.dev2 (2026-07-30)

Documentation: warn Tailscale Funnel users that Claude.ai connectors require the
standard HTTPS port 443 (#2080).


## v2.1.1.dev1 (2026-07-26)

Version line rebased onto the 2.1.0 stable base (no code changes — dev and
stable are identical as of the 2.1.0 promotion). Future promotions carry this
rebase inside the promote PR itself (`rebase_dev_version`).


## v2.0.5.dev3 (2026-07-26)

### Bug Fixes

- Drop the 5-minute wall-clock `total` timeout from the relay's HTTP client so a
  long-lived MCP response stream (the upcoming spec's `subscriptions/listen`) is
  no longer cut every 300 s, forcing the client to re-subscribe. The `sock_read`
  idle timeout still bounds a dead stream, and a new finite `connect` bound
  keeps connection-pool acquisition from hanging new requests when long-lived
  streams occupy the pool.


## v2.0.5.dev2 (2026-07-25)

### Features

- Authorization responses from the add-on's own OAuth servers (the legacy
  `/authorize` view and the none-mode auto-approve `/authorize` view) now carry
  the RFC 9207 `iss` parameter naming the issuer that produced them, on both the
  success redirect and the error redirects. The value is the same issuer the
  add-on's RFC 8414 metadata document advertises. Clients that do not implement
  RFC 9207 ignore the extra query parameter, so existing connectors are
  unaffected.


## v2.0.5.dev1 (2026-07-20)

### Bug Fixes

- Rebase the dev channel onto the 2.0.5 stable base and fold in the #1978
  post-merge parity fixes now shipping in stable: the none-mode auto-approve
  OAuth error responses carry `Cache-Control: no-store` / `Pragma: no-cache`
  (matching the token responses and the custom-component twin), and the
  `_active_oauth_mode` docstring documents its `none_autoapprove` return value.


## v2.0.3.dev3 (2026-07-19)

### Bug Fixes

- When OAuth is off, serve the add-on's own corrected OAuth discovery documents
  plus an invisible auto-approve authorization server, so an MCP connector
  (claude.ai) that intermittently front-loads OAuth discovery resolves against
  the add-on instead of falling through to Home Assistant core's origin-root
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` — which omits
  `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported: ["none"]` and has no
  `registration_endpoint`, so the connector reports "Automatic client
  registration isn't supported" and cannot connect (issue #1969). The webhook
  itself stays unauthenticated (URL-only clients are unaffected) and the OAuth
  flow completes with no Home Assistant login. Switching between OAuth-off and
  `ha_auth` needs no Home Assistant restart.


## v2.0.3.dev2 (2026-07-18)

### Refactoring

- Reduce cyclomatic complexity in `start.py` and `mcp_proxy_dev/__init__.py`
  below the C901 threshold by extracting private helpers (issue #925). No
  behavior change.


## v2.0.3.dev1 (2026-07-18)

Version line re-based onto the stable series (stable is 2.0.2, so dev now
leads it as 2.0.3.devN); the 1.2.3.devN entries below predate this rule.

### Bug Fixes

- Write the proxy-config handoff file with restricted (0600) permissions like
  the OAuth creds file, falling back to a plain write with a logged warning
  when the filesystem cannot honor the mode.


## v1.2.3.dev6 (2026-07-05)

### Documentation

- Note that this proxy is unnecessary with the HA-MCP custom component's
  in-process server, which has its own built-in webhook for remote access.
  The proxy remains for the MCP Server add-on (and, via the
  `mcp_server_url` option, other external servers).


## v1.2.3.dev5 (2026-07-04)

### Added

- ha_auth debug observability: with debug logging enabled, a 401 on the webhook
  now logs WHY the bearer was rejected — no usable bearer, token rejected by
  Home Assistant's validator, or the validator raised — so provider-specific
  login issues (issue #1714's OIDC leg) are diagnosable from the add-on log
  alone. The token itself is never logged.


## v1.2.3.dev4 (2026-07-02)

> **POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE (OAuth users).** This release changes the default
> OAuth mode for *new* enables. Upgrades are engineered to be safe — existing
> OAuth setups are auto-detected and kept on the old (legacy) mode — but if you
> use OAuth, read the notes below. `enable_oauth` stays OFF by default; nothing
> changes for anyone not using OAuth.

### Added

- New default OAuth mode `ha_auth` that delegates authorization to Home
  Assistant's built-in OAuth: you sign in with your Home Assistant account and
  the connector's OAuth fields stay blank (the add-on advertises Client ID
  Metadata Documents, so no client id/secret is needed). It works with any
  hostname regardless of Home Assistant's external URL, and needs no Home
  Assistant restart to enable or disable. Validated live against claude.ai; also
  enables ChatGPT (#1725). Follow-up to #1714.

### Changed

- OAuth's default for a first-time enable is now `ha_auth`. What this means for
  OAuth users:
  - OAuth setups from before this update keep working unchanged — legacy mode is
    auto-detected (from a configured or stored Client ID/Secret) and kept.
  - New / first-time OAuth enables default to the new `ha_auth` mode.
  - Anyone switching modes must delete and re-add their MCP connector: set
    `oauth_mode: ha_auth` (blank credentials) to move to the new mode, or
    `oauth_mode: legacy` to pin the previous client-id/secret flow.
  The legacy flow is unchanged and still available (deprecated).


## v1.2.3.dev3 (2026-07-02)

### Added

- Click-to-restart Repair (HACS-style) now appears the moment a restart is
  needed, not only at the next HA boot: the integration registers a
  `refresh_repairs` service the add-on calls when the integration files
  were updated on disk (new `update_restart_required` issue) or OAuth was
  enabled against stale loaded code (`oauth_restart_required`, which
  previously surfaced only after the very restart it prompts for). The
  stale "integration updated" notification is auto-dismissed once the new
  code actually loads.

### Fixed

- Repair cards now render with proper text: the integration shipped only
  `strings.json`, but custom integrations load runtime translations from
  `translations/en.json`, which was missing.

### Documentation

- Add a "Cloudflare users" troubleshooting section to DOCS.md: disable
  "Block AI training bots" and don't geo-block your AI provider's US IP
  ranges (Claude.ai connects from Anthropic's network, `160.79.104.0/21`)


## v1.2.3.dev2 (2026-07-02)

### Added

- Serve the OAuth metadata at the RFC 8414 / RFC 9728 / OIDC well-known
  locations (issue #1714): the authorization-server document at
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/api/mcp_proxy_dev/oauth` (plus the
  `openid-configuration` variants), and the protected-resource document at the
  path-scoped `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/webhook/<id>`.
  Captured live against claude.ai: the path-scoped document is its first
  fallback probe when the 401's `WWW-Authenticate` pointer is missing, and a
  valid authorization-server document at the well-known path overrides a
  previously mis-cached (HA-core) per-URL client config — healing a broken
  connector with no client-side action. Purely additive routes; HA core's
  root well-known endpoints are untouched.


## v1.2.2 (2026-06-29)

### Fixed

- Remove the `/` from the add-on name ("Nabu Casa / Webhook Proxy for HA MCP" ->
  "Nabu Casa - Webhook Proxy for HA MCP"). Home Assistant Supervisor builds the
  pre-update backup filename from the add-on name and validates it against
  `^[^/]+\.tar$`, so the slash made "Update" with "Create backup before update"
  enabled fail with `does not match regular expression` (issue #1707).

### Documentation

- Correct the "Log inbound requests" option description. It still said requests
  are logged to the Home Assistant log "NOT this addon log", which contradicts
  the v1.2.1 mirroring — the lines now appear in this addon's own log as well
  (issue #1708).


## v1.2.1 (2026-06-28)

### Added

- Mirror inbound-request debug lines into the addon's own log. When "Log
  inbound requests" is on, the lines that were previously only visible in the
  Home Assistant log (Settings → System → Logs) now also appear on the addon's
  Log tab, so you can confirm a client is reaching the server without leaving
  the addon page.

### Fixed

- Log a shutdown reason and run cleanup on a Supervisor stop. The addon now
  handles `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, so stopping it unregisters the webhook (as the
  docs describe) and records why it exited, instead of being killed mid-loop
  with no log line and the webhook left registered.

- Append a "fully restart Home Assistant" hint to the OAuth stale-registration
  errors (`invalid_client` and the browser "Invalid client id" page). The OAuth
  HTTP views only refresh on a full HA restart, so a regenerate / OAuth toggle /
  reinstall can otherwise leave a stale error with no obvious fix. (Client-side
  protocol errors and the upstream 502/500 paths don't get the hint — a restart
  isn't the fix there.)

### Documentation

- Warn that the Claude.ai connector must be deleted and re-created when OAuth
  is toggled on/off or the webhook URL changes — Claude.ai caches the
  authentication mode and URL per connector, so reusing the old one fails (for
  example `invalid client id` on the consent page).


## v1.2.0 (2026-06-15)

### Added

- Add a "Log inbound requests" debug toggle. When enabled, every request that
  reaches the webhook proxy is logged to the Home Assistant log (method, masked
  path, source address, whether an `Authorization` header was present, and the
  upstream response status) — making it easy to confirm whether an MCP client
  such as Claude.ai is actually reaching the server.

### Documentation

- Document the Claude.ai web custom-connector flow end to end (add the
  connector, click **Connect**, then **Allow** on the authorization page) and
  add a quick public-reachability check for diagnosing "Couldn't reach MCP
  server".

## v1.1.0 (2026-05-09)

### Added

- Optional OAuth 2.1 authentication mode for the webhook proxy (beta)
  ([#1184](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/pull/1184))

## v1.0.2 (2026-05-03)

### Fixed

- Surface webhook registration failures instead of silently loading
  ([#1101](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/pull/1101))

## v1.0.1 (2026-03-07)

### Fixed

- Correct webhook proxy Dockerfile COPY paths for Supervisor builds
  ([#725](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/pull/725))

## v1.0.0 (2026-03-06)

### Added

- Nabu Casa and other generic remote access via the webhook proxy
  ([#554](https://github.com/homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp/pull/554))
